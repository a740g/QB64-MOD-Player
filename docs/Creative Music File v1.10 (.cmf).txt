CMF consists of 3 different block structures: header block, instrument block
and a music block.

                        Header Block.

                        Music Block

The music block is single track, polyphonic, with a max of 16 channels.
It adheres to the Standard Midi File format. It is like:

 Music block = <delta time> <Midi event> <delta time> <Midi event>...

 where:       Delta time = amount of time before Midi event (in ticks)

              Midi event = any Midi channel message

Here is where the book gets foggy. Some Midi events are Control Change events
but it doesn't say if all are like that. These are the only ones discussed:

Control Number       Control Data
   66h               1-127 (Used as markers in music)
   67h               0-Melody mode
                     1-Rhythm mode

I don't know of the 0 or 1 are bits or follow the Control Number but it
appears that there will be a 66h then a number between 1 and 127
designating seminote length (1 seminote = 1/128 of a tick or something)
or a 67h and a 0 or 1 to determine the mode. In Rhythm mode, the last
5 channels are:

Channel      Rhythm
12           Bass Drum
13           Snare
14           Tom-tom
15           Top-cymbal
16           High-hat

Control Number      Control Data
   68h                0-127 (Changes pitch upward by the # of 1/128 seminotes.
                             0=Cancel pitch change)

   69h                0-127 (Changes pitch downward by the # of 1/128
                             seminotes. 0=Cancel pitch change)
