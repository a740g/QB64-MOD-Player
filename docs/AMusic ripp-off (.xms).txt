What do you need for the XMS-Format ?
-------------------------------------
You need a Soundcard, of course. This Soundcard should have a OPL2 Chipset
(for example the Soundblaster-Soundcards). A Computer the XMS-Player will
work on any PC with an 386 CPU or Hihger. The XMS-Object File can be used
in own Products. Both XMS-Player and XMS-Object Files are FREEWARE so you
can use them as you want. The XMS-Tracker v1.0B needs at least 150 KB of
your BasicMemory (under DOS). The Tracker will also work fine under a
DOS-Shell Window on an Windows 3.11 or 95 Machine.


XMS-Format and it's fundamental Structure !
-------------------------------------------

This Part of the FAQ is for the Coders. So listen Coders here we go, see what
we have got for you. I hope after that little Introduction it will be easier
for you to understand the Structure of the XMS-Format Tunes. The Tunes you
are using are already packed (compressed).

XMS-Format-Structure:
--------------------
 - The Name of the XMS-Song (Offset 000h). Then it follows the Name of the
   Author (018h), but remember you should only change this when you use
   the XMS-Tracker without it you have to add a Zerobyte. After that the
   26 Instrumenst are coming up (030h). It goes on with the Songlength (3A4h).
   At least the Pattern Number is added to the XMS-Song (3A5h), if you like
   to change anything on the Pattern Number with a Hexeditor please sub one
   Byte first otherwise you will get in trouble by playing this Song. After
   that the Patterntable comes up with at least 128 Byte (3A6h). Every
   XMS-Song has got an id.String it is "MaDoKaN96", please don't change
   anything here (426h). Now the Table with the Tracks is coming up (430h).
   You may ask yourself what's a Track and a Pattern. In the XMS-Songs a
   Track belong to a Pattern ,as for example in a Mod, S3M or XM'S File,
   A Pattern has got Nine Tracks. Each Track belongs to a Voice. That's it.
