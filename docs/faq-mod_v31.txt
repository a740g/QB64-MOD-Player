[1.1] History and Purpose of the FAQ

What is the purpose of this FAQ?   Originally, it was centered around a.b.s.mods
of course, and dealt with the problems that are usually encountered there in posted
questions.  It was originally started by jester to help new readers of the group
find programs and modules, decode the posts, make contributions of their own and
give pointers on where to find further information.

Since its original inception, the scene has changed considerably, and absm
along with it.  The questions, as ever, exactly the same. (although it now
centres around the increasingly dominant windows trackers).  This was the
reason why I attempted to update this FAQ, and why we are now looking at a
fairly extensive update, including a short new section on the selection of
soft synths trackers are using more and more.

This FAQ does NOT attempt to teach you how to make music, but there are sections
on all aspects of MOD creation including pointers on various online tutorials.
Neither will the FAQ go into explanations of certain editors/trackers/players.
There are pointers to both sites and information where you can learn all you
have to learn about all these subjects *in* the FAQ.   Any opinion given on
software/hardware options are personal views of the paricular writer and should
be taken with the regulation pinch of salt.   You should, as always, try to
make your own judgements.

I work (like most of us) and keep up with tracking in my own spare (ha ha ha)
time.  Therefore, time is extremely precious.  To that end, I can't spend
much time hunting down links and/or programs mentioned on absm.   I only know
my own kit(MS-DOS/Windows/GUS/SB), so I depend on your feedback and your
contributions.  If you have something you feel belongs here or any other
form of constructive criticism, don't hesitate to email me with it.   You
can reach me at:  rebriffr@netcomuk.co.uk

If you've contributed to the FAQ, your name and address (optional) will be
listed.  If you have contributed previously and your name is not credited,
please let me know.

Thank you.

[1.1.1] Submitting to the FAQ

As I already stated, the information included in this FAQ is believed to be
correct. If you happen to find errors, inaccuracies or out-of-date information
though, don't hesitate to inform me of it. The same applies to suggestions you
may have concerning additions or omissions.   Do bear in mind the fast moving
nature of the MOD scene however, and the time constraints on all the FAQ
contributors...  We're only human too....

When submitting to the FAQ, be sure to include all information that is necessary.
The easiest way for me is if you take the present FAQ as a guide-line. Pre-written
and ready-to-use submissions are a lot less prone to errors I could make in
editing and summarising your information, helping both of us.

Be sure to state which version of the FAQ and which section you are referring to.
This is version 3.1 and is the latest version, but there will probably be much
earlier versions around for a while.  So if you think you have something to
say, try to obtain the most recent version before going to the trouble of
writing a submission.

Thanks once again

[1.2] Modules (What are mods?)

Originally written for the absm FAQ by jester <jester@fmr.maschinenbau.tu-
darmstadt.de>

Modules are digital music files, made up of a set of samples (the instruments)
and sequencing information, telling a mod player when to play which sample on
which track at what pitch, optionally performing an effect like vibrato, for
example. Thus mods are different from pure sample files such as WAV or AU,
which contain no sequencing information, and MIDI files, which do not include
any custom samples/instruments. Mods are extremely popular in the demo world
and offer a way of making music of an acceptable level of quality rather cheaply.
With the advent of high-quality sound hardware, new generations of mods may even
rise to a sound quality nearing that of professional equipment.

Mods' sequencing information is based on patterns and tracks. A pattern is a
group of tracks with a certain length, usually 64 rows (see 1.3). The tracks
are independent of each other, meaning that a four track mod can play four
voices or notes simultaneously. The patterns can be sequenced in a playlist,
so that repeating the same sequence of patterns doesn't require rewriting of
them.

This makes mods a hybrid between pure sample data files such as WAV, VOC or
IFF/8SVX and pure sequencing information files like MIDI. One of the most
frequently asked questions is "how do I convert a WAV to MOD?". This can be
done, but is rather senseless.  The other way around might be interesting for
people with enormous hard drives, so they could listen to what used to be a
mod at higher quality than before at the cost of several megabytes of drive space
(10 MB/min. at 16 bits, 44.1kHz, stereo), or for those who want to show off a
mod to others who don't have a mod player (or worse, can only play 8kHz AU
files..

Numerous mods have been released that were basically huge samples off a CD
(is there a connection to CD-ROM drives gaining increasing popularity?), the
only parts actually sequenced were the chorus bits. Most of these mods were
some form of top ten hit. These are, in effect, WAV to MOD conversions. I
don't mind them floating around, but it is a widely acknowledged opinion that
these kinds of mods defeat their own purpose. I therefore don't recommend their
making (but this is my opinion). Note that this is NOT the same as using sampled
drum loops or riffs in mods. While I don't like these myself either, these do
require a lot more sequencing than huge 64KB chunks of a complete song.

Since jester wrote this section, things have changed enormously, so it seems
only right to add a few words to bring us completely up to date.  While
compiling Version 3.0 of this FAQ I was aware of the increasing role being
played in MOD production by soft synths such as Hammerhead and Stomper (two of
the most popular programs at that time (May 1998)) and sample editing programs
such as Cool Edit and Sound Forge.  This was the predominant reason for their
inclusion in the updated FAQ.

Ah, but what a difference a year makes :-)

Now we are faced with trackers with capabilites none of would have believed
only a couple of years ago, and the ability to literally generate every single
note of our MODs - still without the need for expensive keyboards, effects etc.
It goes without saying that you'll probably spend a wodge of hard earned cash
on some carefully selected programs, but the original MOD premise can still hold
true as much today as it did at the beginning of the scene.  The only real difference
is in the massive strides in music production on most computer platforms - that and
multi-channel trackers bring MOD production so close to 'real-world' music that
it may prove the biggest change to the MOD scene yet.

There are a few losers in this story, and unfortunately judging by the results
of this update, they do seem to be the older platforms (Apple II, Atari and
even dear ol' DOS).  It may also be that I just don't have the time to do some
really exhaustive searches on the 'net; mostly I use either the web search engines
or (at a pinch) Archie.  Most information I gather though generally comes from
YOU, the people I speak to on the 'scene' on a daiy basis.  Keeping a FAQ up to
date simply by word of mouth is not gonna do it, of course.  I am really keen
on involving other platforms in the FAQ so if you use any platform OTHER than
DOS/Windows, I'd be really interested in hearing from you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1.3] Terminology used in this FAQ

- Throughout this FAQ, modules will be referred to as 'mods'. This term will
  be used for all types of modules, be they M.K., 8CHN, ULT, S3M, XM, IT or
  anything else.

IMPORTANT: Note that the term MOD (i.e. capitalized) refers to the group of
mods that have this filename extension as well as being a generic term for
all tracked material

- A 'track' is a module voice. The number of tracks denotes the number of notes/
  instruments/voices that can play simultaneously.

- A 'pattern' is the largest sub-unit modules are composed of. Patterns are
  arranged in an order or sequencing list, so a pattern can be played several
  times within the same module. Patterns have a fixed length in most formats,
  but can also be of variable length in others. The standard M.K. pattern is
  4 tracks by 64 rows, for example

- A 'row' is the smallest unit of time measurement in which notes can be placed
  on tracks. A M.K. pattern has 64 rows. OKT and FAR, for example, can have patterns
  of differing length in the same mod.  If you've ever used a spreadsheet program,
  this will be very familiar

- A 'slot' is an element of a row, dedicated to hold a specific piece of information.
  These are notes, volume and effects, for example.

- A 'column' is an element of a track, such as the note column, the volume
  column and the effect column. A 'column' is a group of 'slots' of one type
  in a common track.

- A 'sample' is a digitized sound included in the mod, which serves as an
  instrument. As mods don't use a fixed instrument set (as General MIDI does),
  anything can be used as an instrument, including noises or human voices.

- A 'channel' is a source of emitted sound. Channel and track are often used
  interchangeably in the mod community. The more general understanding of
  channels is similar to recording parlance.  A record for example could be
  made in a 24 channel studio (where each of the 24 channels can be finally
  mixed to make a stereo (ie 2 channel) record.)

- A 'player' is a program that decodes mods and ouputs these on a sound device.

- A 'tracker' is a program that enables creation of mods. Trackers usually
  feature a 'player' and are often referred to as MOD 'editors'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1.4] Commonly Used Abbreviations (see section 2 for mod type abbrevs)

AWE -	Used to describe the group of 'wavetable' soundcards produced by Creative
        Labs.

BPM - Beats per minute. When used in mods, this usually refers to how many groups
      of four rows are played per minute at default tempo (i.e. ticks per row)
      settings. This default tempo is 6 in MOD and S3M. Setting the tempo to 3
      means that as many groups of eight rows are played per minute as set by
      the BPM set command.

CxSpd - Sampling rate at which a sample is reproduced by a tracker/player when
        it encounters the note C in octave x.

DAC - Digital to Analogue Converter. Digital sound output medium used with the
      parallel port of a computer.

DMA - Direct Memory Access (method of transferring data quickly across the
      computer's bus, DMA channel is a sound card parameter)

DSP - Digital Signal Processors.  Used when decribing software that changes or
      effects the original sound.

EWS - Terratec sound card

FM  - Frequency Modulation sound synthesis (used by Adlib and SB in FM mode)

FT1 - Mr.H/Triton's FastTracker 1.xx, MS-DOS MOD tracker

FT2 - Triton's FastTracker II

GUS - Gravis Ultrasound (sound card)

Hz  - Hertz, metric unit. 1 Hz = 1/sec. Used to express frequencies.

IRQ - Interrupt (not only, but also a sound card parameter)

M4W -	MOD4Win player

MPP -	MODplug Player

MPT -	MODplug Tracker

MT - 	Mad Tracker

MT2-	Mad Tracker 2

PAS - Pro Audio Spectrum (sound card)

PT  - ProTracker (Amiga tracker)

SB  - SoundBlaster (sound card)

ST3 - PSI/Future Crew's Scream Tracker 3.2

[2] Types of Mods

This is a brief summary of mod types. For further information, see the document-
ation of file formats and/or the associated trackers' documentation.

In this list, Name refers to the identifier string found in modules of this type
or a term, which unambiguously identifies the module format type. The Default
Extension is the filename extension typically given to the mod type.   Note that,
even though they are often used, extensions do not clearly define formats. The
No. of Tracks is pretty obviously the number of tracks mods stored in this format
can have. The No. of Samples states how many instrument (sample) slots are
available in the format. The Sample Properties denote the no. of bits (i.e. the
resolution) the format can store and wether the CxSpd is fixed or variable. The
Associated Tracker entry is only meant as an example.

        production. See the Trackers section for more information
***** - Seems to have MIDI-style Note-on/Note-off commands; can play multiple
        instances of the same instrument in one channel.

==============================================================================

[3] Playing Mods

The most essential ingredient to the newcomer to MODs is probably the hardest
piece of kit to pin down - the player.  For generations now (hee hee), absm
and amm has rung to the shouts of 'your player sucks' and the like.  Simple
fact is, like the music heard on this software, it's a personal choice.  A
few years ago Cubic Player was the only player worth defending, but today the
choice is nothing short of amazing.

A player usually has some kind of feature to show you pattern totals, sample
information and song notes. Most trackers write short notes in the 'samples'
section of the MOD.  Think of these as sleeve liner notes and you wouldn't be
far wrong!  Some players even have 'scopes to show you the fancy, wavy
soundwaves that captivated most early MOD listeners, although this is a
practice not being followed in most Windows based trackers.  And consequently, it
probably is the same for most other platforms.  Bit of a shame, I know millions
of people who are now suffering 'scope withdrawal :-)
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3.1] Amiga

The major work on this section was supplied by Steven Innell <spi@dcs.qmw.ac.uk>,
Christian Stieber <stieber@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> and Heikki Kantola
<hkantola@cc.helsinki.fi> and originally dates from 1994 -1997.   The 1998
updated information was completed by Steve Gilmore and Hugh Hulme. 1999 updated
information from Steve Gilmore.

All of the following players can be found on aminet in mus/play/ (see 6.1).  

Because of the constant confusion surrounding Aminet at the time of updating,
I checked the main Aminet site in Germany

http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/

and that seems to be fine.   Lots and lots of players and peripherals here,
but I noticed that the accent now seems to rest with MP3 players :-)
Nonetheless, there are still plenty of trackers/editors/players here so it's
worth the browse.   Unfortunately, and as normal, no Amiga user wanted to
assist us in the FAQ updating, so if you want to review and comment on the
Amiga players in more depth, please contact me.  All of the following players
can be found on aminet FTP in mus/play/ (see 6.1) or at the main website
address at

http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/aminet/mus/play/

        "All of the following players are proper applications, i.e. they
        use windows and don't hack the hardware (except for the sound
        hardware). All of the following players use external players to
        allow for an unlimited number of formats (provided that somebody
        writes a player). All of the following players support Pro/Noise/
        SoundTracker, ScreamTracker, FastTracker. I believe that most of
        the players support MultiTracker and TakeTracker as well
        (DeliTracker certainly does)".

I can't vouch for the accuracy of the above statement, which was part of the
original FAQ.  As I mentioned above, I do not use an Amiga so it's more than
a little difficult for me to make any authorative comments.  I'd really love
for an Amiga user to get involved (hint, hint)

* Delitracker 2.27 
 
        As with Eagleplayer, a majority of the program has been re-written to 
	speed it up, as well as adding several new players (Deli-AY being one), 
	and improved S3M support. There are also a host of new "Genies", such as 
	the Christmas Snow-Scene, and The Dr-Who genie. Fast Tracker II XM support 
	has been added in version 2.14.  This player is my personal favorite 
	(editor's note: Steven Innell speaking), having a better gui, and nicer 
	"feel". It too is a shareware production, costing around $20 (or 20 DM) 
	again to register for. All features are available in the demo version.

Checking the readme on the Aminet site, I came across this blurb:

This politely (huh?) multitasking program will play all popular sound program
modules available on the amiga. Currently it supports over 120 (!)  different
module formats plus one special format for modules which contain their own
player. ProTracker and PT-like players are internal; additional players are
loaded from disk. That means you can very easily add/update players by placing
them into the DeliPlayers directory.

Shareware: the requested shareware fee is $US 20 or 20 DM. Registered users
will be shipped a disk with the latest release version of DeliTracker.

http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/aminet/mus/play/DeliTracker227.lha

* EaglePlayer1.54c
  
	This player now has been re-written in areas, making it faster, and
        better looking. It also added several new "eagleplayers" which has
        increased the number of mod/music formats which it will play. It
        currently supports a majority of PC mod formats (S3M, MTM,
        FastTracker V1) and many Amiga style mods (too numerous to mention).
        You can also use some of the players from Delitracker, although some
        do not work, or are already included with the distribution archive.
        This is a Shareware production, and most features are available
        (except saving of configs, and mods) in the demo version.
	The registration fee is around $20.

While I was rooting around in this directory I also noticed what I presumed
to be the next generation of this player 2.01.  This is what Aminet had to
say on the subject:

        - supports more than 150 music formats including most common sample
          formats (including CDDA, AIFF, WAV, Datatype, raw formats...)
        - completely hardware-independent replay system, redirecting the
          sound signal via custom 'amplifiers' to the audio hardware.
        - supports toccata.library for Toccata, Melody and Prelude sound
          cards
        - extremely fast mixing routines
        - currently supports 64 custom programs, e.g. amplifiers, user-
          interfaces, analyzers, scopes, external depackers, listviews,
          managers etc.

  	FEATURES:

        - carefully and extensively adapted playroutines. nearly all of
          them support volume and balance, and most common players support
          the modular amplifier system.
        - replays with 8, 14, and 16 bit resolution (depending on the
          hardware)
  	- supports free scalable mono, stereo and surround replay
  	- replay speed can be controlled easily, including pitch for several
          sound formats.
  	- music-fadein and fadeout
  	- plays from fastram system
        - supports all common system features, such as ARexx, commodity,
          appwindow, iconify, asynchronous online help, font-sensivity,
          pubscreens, hotkey...
        - supports xpk, xfd, powerpacker, imploder, crunchmania, lh.library,
          and more formats for decrunching, and any type of archive may be
          accessed like a directory.
  	- is highly system-compliant and uses heavy internal multitasking
        - external programs (players, amplifiers, engines) are loaded when
          needed and removed automatically.
        - CyberGraphX is directly supported by some scopes.
  	- configuration via configfile, tooltype and commandline arguments
  	- allows timer.device, CIA and VBlank playspeed timing
  	- does not interfere with modem use
        - easy and comfortable configuration that covers numerous details
        - window-positions, player and engine settings, current module,
          each internal and external option will be saved globally with a
          single action
        - module info includes playtime calculation for soundformats like
          Protracker, Oktalyzer, SonicArranger, Jamcracker, DigiBooster and
          most sample formats
  
        REQUIREMENTS:

        - an Amiga with 68020 CPU

* D.A.S.ModulePlayer 3.5b
 
	Plays M.K., NST, 6CHN, 8CHN, MTM, S3M, Quadracomposer, MED, Future 
	Composer, SoundMon 2.0, FRED, MusicAssembler and David Whittaker mods.
        New formats may be added via external player libraries. Requires MUI
        for its GUI. Requires AmigaOS 2.0+. Crippled shareware 25 AUD, 70 FIM,
        $15.

There are several DAS Player peripheral files on Aminet, but the player itself
seems to be absent.  I suggest you root around in there anyway, maybe you'll
find something else.  Be aware though that the last files posted there on this
subject are dated between 1994 and 1996.  I suspect the player is still active
somewhere, but - short of dragging every Aminet directory - not for poor ol'
me...

These players were found there...(yaaaaahhhh!)

* PS3M V3.12
 
        V3.12 of this player is now the first player to support the PC
        FastTracker2 XM style mod. It also supports the other PC favorites
        (S3M - hence the name, MTM and Fasttracker V1), as well as the standard
        Amiga MOD format, and also PlaySid format, providing you have the
        playsid.library in your	LIBS: directory.

http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/aminet/mus/play/ps3m312.lha

* Hippoplayer V2.44
  
	This is the second player to support the FastTracker 2 XM mods. It is
        also one of the only players that will uncompress ZIPped files (as well
        as LHA as do Eagle/Deli, and LZX'ed files) saving you the bother of
        having to do it 8*). The sound quality from this player in most cases
        is IMO the best for the higher channel numbered PC mods (8-16 Ch in XM
        and S3M formats). It also supports the standard protracker format, and
        Playsid (providing you have the Playsid.library as with PS3M). In fact,
        the XM support was taken from PS3M, and so the player routines for the
        PC format mods are nigh on identical to those from PS3M, the difference
        being Hippo has a better front-end, making it nicer, and easier to use.
        Hippoplayer now incorporates directory opus,Right Mouse Button selection
        boxes and external "Scopes" such as the PT-Note  scope and various
        equalisers. Several enhancements and additions have been made to the
        program in this latest release.

http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/aminet/mus/play/hippoplayer.lha

Once again, sorry for the sparseness of the information but where are all the
Amiga users?  As always with Aminet it's generally worth a major browse...
Exasperated with the search for Amiga users, I went looking for myself.  I've
used the MushyPD site a couple of times because I had previously found some
very good Amiga IFF/SVX samples there.  The MushyPD site is at

http://www.mushy-pd.demon.co.uk

and it had these players available in Feb  1998:

* MEDPlay.lha - MED player for AMOS

* MMPl_CLI.Lha - 75K - Mod player written in AMOS Plays Sound/Pro/Noisetracker
  modules as well as Octamed module, AMOS .Abk modules and tracker banks.

* MusicMeister.lha - 248K - A .abk music player with some example mods

* TitV1_5.Lha - 63K - Mod player written in AMOS .

* TitV1_7.Lha - 58K - Titchyplay CLI Version 1.7 Written in AMOS Pro. 

Tobias Reckhard (jester) finally got so irritated by the lack of information
on Amiga's that he was spurred into doing an Archie search, and this is what
he found (Archie information can be found in Appendix E):

So there ya go, obviously having an Amiga-head working on this section would
yield some better results, but there is certainly enough references here for
you to start finding some of the players mentioned.  Archie is still a good
(if slightly techie) search method, so by all means use it.   A complete
tutorial by jester can be found in the appendices of this FAQ.   Any links
you come up with could then be emailed to me for inclusion in this section.
With full marks to you of course!  Instant fame, what more could you want?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3.2] Atari

Thanks to Dan <cs93dlh@dcs.ex.ac.uk> for this information which was written
between 1994-1997.  The updated information supplied by Steve Gilmore, who
isn't an Atari user so *none* of the actual software has been checked or
reviewed.

The updated 1999 information was supplied by the wonderful efforts of
frustrated Atari owner James Smith <jimsmith@zetnet.co.uk> who contacted me
on absm complaining about the lack of Atari playable MODs.  Thought the best
way to answer his question was to put him to work answering it for himself.

The programs mentioned here can be still be downloaded via ftp from 

atari.archive.umich.edu/pub/atari/music
 
(the /sound directory looks useful too!) and its mirrors. The other previously
mentioned site in the FAQ (micros.hensa.ac.uk) had this too say when I visited
the page in January 1998:
 
      "In January, due to the lack of interest in Atari and Amiga software, 
       we plan to remove these platforms from our site." :=(

I suspect that this situation has only become worse.  As James found out,
finding any halfway decent Atari site is getting to be a real hit and miss
affair.  Just getting through to the two sites mentioned here take endless
tries and as of this writing I am still not able to connect to the
artari.archive.umich site.  The site mentioned below (zaba.simplenet) is
still the official Paula Rzeczkowska Appreciation Society site familiar
to older Atari users, however it would appear that all the software for
download is now wholly Windows/DOS based.

        Atari ST: This machine is very bad at playing MODs 'cause its sound
        basically isn't up to it. However, a player does exist. It is called
        Paula and is now at version 2.4. In order to run on the base ST you
        also need a driver called Petra, which is distributed with Paula. This
        will handle 4 track PT MOD format.

http://zaba.simplenet.com/mod/players/modplayatari.html

There are three programs featured on this site: MegaPlayer 1.5, Paula
(version 2.4) and Ultimate Tracker 2.5.  Definitely worth a visit if you are
an Atari user...

Anyway, this following information was from the last version of the FAQ.  

        Atari STE/TT/Mega STE: These Ataris have massively improved sound
        abilities, roughly equivalent to the Amiga. You can use Paula
        (mentioned above) to playback 4-track PT MODs at a very respectable
        quality. Other 4 track players are DeskTracker and StarTracker.

        Atari Falcon030: This latest of Atari's computers has a sound system
        as standard which blows away all but the most expensive of PC
        soundcards. It has 8-voice 16-bit stereo sound at 50kHz. This means
        it is very good at mod playback. It also has a Motorola 56001 DSP
        chip installed as standard this chip can mix voices very fast,
        making 32 track mod playback possible at unbelievable quality.  

There are literally hundreds of 4-track MOD players out there, ranging
from Paula through BSW, CPU_MOD and many more. There are fewer 8-track
players and only one 32-track player. The best players for sound quality are:

* CPU_MOD - Handles 4-track PT MODs only, but gives the best sound quality I've 
  heard. Will run in the background but is expensive on CPU time.

* BOBTracker - Handles 4, 6 or 8-track mods in a variety of mod formats (not
  S3M or MTM though). Sound playback uses the DSP for mixing and quality is
  good and very little CPU time is used. The DSP is also used to improve the
  sound quality of the samples in realtime and boost the bass and/or treble
  if desired
* MegaPlayer - Handles up to 32 tracks, virtually and mod format ever,
  including S3M and MTM. DSP is used for mixing, so little CPU time is used.
  Distributed with MegaTracker (see 4.1.2)

James Smith's efforts produced the following relevant information:

I have not seen a version of the MegaTracker released for a number of years
and suspect that it also is no longer under development.

The best 8-track player for the STE is Octalyser. Development on this has
ceased on the Atari platform and it is now FREE and available from many
sources on the Net and on Atari CDs.

* Graumf Tracker.

Another one that handles up to 32 tracks in multiple formats. The home page
for this has not been updated in some time - I did hear that a new version is
under development but have been unable to confirm this yet. (I suspect that
the code has been released and another programmer may have taken over the
work on it.)

http://sectorone.atari.org

Judging by James' input above, most of the player information probably still
holds true, although I had immense difficulty getting through to the two sites
he mentioned, so I've just left one I know does work..   James also added the
following information on Accelerators and Clones as he thought it may be of
interest to other frustrated Atari users:

Accelerators:
There are a number of accelerators available from limited outlets for most of
the original Atari models.

- PAK -  for ST and STE.
- Turbo28 - for the Mega ST
- Veloce and Veloce+ - for STE only
- Nemesis, CenTurbo II, AfterBurner and Tempest - for Falcon.

Many of these not only increase the pure speed of the computer but also add
the option of memory expansions.

Clones:
The four main entrants in this field are DirecT, Hades, Medusa and Milan.
All of these are much faster than the original Atari family of machines and
are being heavily invested in by the manufacturers who recognise that there
is still an interest in TOS based computers. These come in various 'flavours'
and the latest projects include 080 versions that will be give 300MHz performance
and above.

It must be said at this point that accelerated machines and clones have
compatability problems with earlier ST software and some require dedicated
versions. As this is a relatively new area, not all programmes have yet been
updated to cope with the new hardware configurations.

Anyone wishing to check out music from Atari games and demos should have a
look at The Dead Hackers Site where there is a page devoted to Atari music.
The tracks are not 'hacked' but are provided by the authors themselves.

http://wombat.ludvika.se/dhs/scene.html

Once there, go to the Module Archive. (It has not been updated since September
so must be due for another large influx any time now !!)

Just before I finished this FAQ update, I had another email from Jim, which I
may as well print in full because it contains information on the current state
of play...

        "Just got a mail from Thomas of New Beat Developments about his 
        new Atari Tracker:-

         > Flex Tracks will only support .MOD files, max 8 channels.
         The reason I started this project was to make the best player
         possible for this format for include in games, demos, etc,
         and .XM, .S3m, .DTM,  etc is too slow for games, so...

        > The tracker will have some extras not found in ordinary trackers.
        It will hopefully use DMA all the way, which means it will be
        very useful for games and demos (it will take about 5% 030-power
        to play)  The tracker and replay-sources will be freeware.

        Although this was not quite what I was hoping for, at least it proves
        that there are still some people supporting the Atari platform - you
        may wish to mention that in the MODFAQ.......

        I still have not been able to get the info on the .IT mod format for
        my pal Denis, so he has not done any work on adding this option to
        DBE yet.

        There is also no news yet on the future of Graumf, so I will just
        have to wait and see what happens there.

Many thanks to Jim for all his help!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3.3] Mac

Pleonist (currently offline) added a lot of new information to the later part
of this section.  Most information, however is from the original FAQ.
Additional 1999 updating (and all further Mac info) from absm regular Glen
Warner <gdwarner@ricochet.net>.  Please feel free to contact Glen directly if
you have any further information or know of a program you think we should be
mentioning.

For a description of Player Pro and Sound Tracker, the obviously most popular Mac programs,
see section 4.1.3

Before we get into a very confusing area :-) Glen Warner offers a little simple
advice:

        For the most part, any Macintosh shareware application written will
        end up on the Info-Mac Archives. Hard drive space is finite, so some
        things get deleted. If you are looking for anything, try the Info-Mac
        Archive's search engine:

        http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Abstracts/Recent-Summary.html

        Simply type in what you are looking for and, if its there, it will be
        found.

If you really wish to play with some of the older programs mentioned here, try

HitSquad: http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/mac

A very wise idea considering the oldness of the next few paragraphs.  However,
with the help of Glen and other committed Mac users, the next update of the
FAQ will see this entire section rewritten.  OK, so I'm dreaming but it's a
worthwhile goal eh?

Rich "Akira" Pizor <pizor@lclark.edu> noted this in the original FAQ:

        * The Macintosh-tracker. This freeware program plays MODs compatible
          with the Mar Epsie's Tracker, Player-Pro and the Sound-Tracker. It
          also features icons courtesy of Skaven and the Future Crew.

        * Alpha-Tracker. This system extension is a tiny, faceless application
          that automatically plays randomly selected MODs in the background
          while you work.  Slightly old, supports most 4-track formats.

        * MusicBox XCMD. This XCMD for HyperCard adds a very functional MOD
          player to a HyperCard stack, allowing the more adventurous Mac owner
          to quickly and  easily design their own MOD player. Supports most
          4-track formats.

        * Mod Player 1.3.1. Newly added to the info-mac archives, this program
          is designed to play mods with as small a footprint in the system
          memory heap as possible.  There are no bells and whistles, but this
          little gem is great for anyone running a low-end system.  Compatible
          with most mods that work with Sound-Trecker.

Glen Warner reports no updates since November '98 (version 1.1.2)

Lyman Green <lymang@uswsay.glaxo.com> added this comment on 21 Dec 1994:

        * SoundApp 1.5.1 by Norman Franke will play or convert sound files
          dropped onto it. Currently, it supports: SoundCap, SoundEdit, AIFF,
          AIFF-C, System 7 sound, Sun Audio AU, NeXT SND, Windows WAV, Creative
          VOC, Amiga MOD (including Oktalyzer, MED/OctaMED and some other
          variations with up to 32 tracks), Amiga IFF/8SVX, Sound Designer
          II, DVI ADPCM, Studio Session Instruments and any 'snd' resource
          file. SoundApp can convert all of these formats to System 7 sound,
          sound suitcase, AIFF, WAV and NeXT formats.  SoundApp can also
          convert QuickTime soundtracks and audio CD tracks to AIFF, System
          7 sound or suitcase formats. Mod playback is PowerPC-accelerated
          on Power Macs.

The following paragraph is from the SoundApp help file:

        Amiga MOD: This is not really a sound format but a music format.
        It stores digitized instruments and contains a musical score which
        produces a lengthy composition with a very small amount of data.
        There have been various extensions to this format, but SoundApp
        only supports those which Sound Trecker 2.2 supports. These include
        Amiga SoundTracker, StarTracker, NoiseTracker, ProTracker (4-track),
        Amiga StarTracker (4- and 8-track), Oktalyzer (4-8 track), Amiga
        MED/OctaMED (4-16 track MMD0/1/2 formats), IBM FastTracker (4-, 6-
        and 8-track), IBM TakeTracker (1-32 track). SoundApp does not
        support MTM or S3M formats. Native code will be used for MOD
        playback on a Power Macintosh.

http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~franke/SoundApp/

Glen Warner did some digging and came up with this:

Most recent update: January '99. Current version is 2.51. This small program
plays mods in all formats (IT coming in next version). Handles nearly all
sound formats. Can extract sound tracks from QT movies.

Minimum System requirements: ".... at least System 7.0, Apple's Sound Manager
3.1 or greater, the Drag Manager (aka Macintosh Drag-and-Drop, part of System
7.5) and at least a Macintosh with a 68020 or a Power Macintosh. QuickTime 2.0
or greater is required to manipulate QuickTime movies."

This program is a must-have if you do *anything* with sound.

New Japanese version available: http://www.naotaka.com/SoundApp/

New French version avaiable: http://home.worldnet.fr/gazengel/

New Swedish version available: http://home3.swipnet.se/~w-32127/soundapp/

The URL discussed in the earlier FAQ is:    

ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/gst/snd/

and I doubt it still exists...

Pleonist (m.j.hall@btinternet.com) did some research in this section and this
is what he returned as of January 1998:

* MACMODPRO

        by Jean - Paul Mikkers, and Ported to Mac by Nullsoft, (Dmitry Boldyrev)
        the creator of Mac Mik Mod, DSM and others. It is 100% compatible with
        IT among other formats.

	NB. Mikit is also available for win95/nt and Linux at the same address

Glen Warner wote this on the subject:

MikIT is no longer on the Info-Mac Archives, no longer at the author's
homepage. An e-mail from a PC programmer (who shall remain nameless since I
don't have his okay to name him) may shed a little light: In response to my
inquiry about the availability of some sort of IT 2.14 converter:

        "... The coder of MikIT already does have the decompression code
        working, but there have been some political/commercial problems
        with the author of the Mac port of it, hence I don't expect that
        there will be any future Mac versions of MikIT."

A couple years back, it was very difficult to find a mod player that supported
the S3M format. As you can see, those days are over. The difficulty now is
getting players/trackers which support the IT 2.14 format. Thus far, there is
no mod player or tracker that supports the compression scheme used in IT 2.14.

Fortunately, there is MacAmp Lite:

http://www.macamp.com/lite/lite.shtml#start

(shareware; US $5.00).

While primarily an MP3 player, MacAmp Lite also supports several sound formats:
CD Audio, .669, AMF, .DSM, .FAR, .M15, .MED, .MOD, .MP1, .MP2, .MP3, .MTM,
.S3M, .STM, .ULT, .XM, and .IT  Interestingly, the same programmer that wrote
MacMikMod and MikIT is primarily responsible for MacAmp Lite.  IT support
(as is support for any format mentioned) is via Plug-ins. By now, all the
programmers involved in creating trackers have a copy of MacAmp Lite and
the IT plug-in; it's only a matter of time before they all support the new
format.

One caveat: You have to allocate a *lot* of RAM to MacAmp Lite for it to play,
say, "Dirty Walk" (from Necros' FM-System disk). If it quits when you try to
get it to play something, give it more RAM.

	NB. Player pro also available for win95/NT

Glen wrote this in 1999:

PlayerPRO 5.0x upgrade CD is now available ... but I found some troubling
upgrade 'requirements' and I am e-mailing an inquiry. Basically, they want
you to have purchased a copy of the PlayerPRO CD *after* August '98. The
problem here is that I ordered mine way back in '95 or so ... so naturally,
I am asking questions!

I believe the 'August '98' date is when Quadmation began distributing
PlayerPRO, and I purchased mine directly from the author.
   
* ModPlayer 2.12

	mod-player-212.hqx File Size:469.8 K Licence:Shareware    

	Description:
	ModPlayer is a simple music program. Supported file formats are: MOD, 
        MADx, MED, S3M, MTM, XM, 669, OKTA and IT. 
   
	Requirements: System 7.xx, M68020 or higher, 1500 kb of free RAM,
        Color monitor (256 colors or more) 

Glen Warner found this info on a new version:

ModPlayer 2.16 

Small player. Supports MOD, MADx, OKTA, MED, MTM, S3M, XM, 669 and IT
(uncompressed). Good interface. System requirements same as last version.
US $10.00 shareware. Plays for 15 minutes and quits. Shareware notice shows
up each time you start the app.

http://www.utu.fi/~jariuppa/

and then he discovered more info on the ZSS Player for us....

* The ZSS Player 

        Supports MOD, MADF, MADG (PlayerPRO's format; support is somewhat
        spotty), MTM and S3Ms. Minimum requirements: 68020 processor, System
        6.0.7.  There's a Beta available at the web page, version 1.0B
        (PowerMacs only). This version adds support for ITs (uncompressed).
        Unfortunately, it crashes after playing these after a few minutes
        (other formats work fine). The author is working on a fix.
        Development on the ZSS Player has slowed due to the programmer getting
        a Real Job(tm).

        I am unable to check the functionality of the MADx translations; all
        the MADx files I have are MADH, which neither the new version nor the
        previous version supports.

[3.4] MS-DOS

Whenever I field a newsgroup question about how good is this player or that,
I always refer the poster to Randy K Abel's <rabel1@dsp.com> massive work of
love "IBM MOD Players Compared", is still the most complete listing of players
seen so far.  As of the last update (Sept 98) however, DOS programs such as
Sound Club, FT2, IT etc still do fine, obviously the top votes are being
concentrated between Windows programs such as MODplug Player (top choice of
voters) and MOD4Win.

The continuing decline of DOS players/editors is now a fact of life with
most newbies on the newsgroups using some form of Windows.  Anyway, WWW
users may wish to check out the "IBM MOD Players Compared!" www page at

http://www.dsp.net/rabel1/top10.html

The listing can also be sent to you by email simply by contacting Randy
direct.

* Cubic Player
   
  	Description:
	Handles the following formats:- AMS, MOD, NST, WOW, XM, IT, S3M, DMF,
  	MTM, ULT, 669, OKT, PTM, MIDI, WAV(!) & CD Audio. Sound Cards that are
  	supported:- Gravis Ultrasound, Ultrasound MAX, Ultrasound Daughterboard,
  	Soundblaster 1.x, 2.x, Pro, 16, 16 ASP, AWE 32 & compatibles, WSS 
	compatibles cards, Pro Audio Spectrum Series & quiet mode. This Player 
	still lacks good IT support.
   
There has been a lot of speculation about the fate and/or whereabouts of Cubic
and, at the time of writing the last update, I was still no wiser.   I found
a site then at:

http://home4.swipnet.se/~w-41420/cubic/mixer.html

At the time of this update (1999) the page is still there, although looking
much the worse for wear and with a last update date of 01/05/1997.  Doing a
little further digging, I came across

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/4107/

which states it is the 'official Cubic site.  But then here's another:

http://www.cubic.org/player/

Yaaaahhh!!  Judging from the state of this site Cubic seem to moving right
along, a new version (2.5.1) of the player is available as is what appears
to be a Cubic SDK download.  My thanks to newsgroup mate wOOd (of Acid Demons)
for that final piece of the puzzle.  They are obviously intending a pure
Windows and Unix versions soon, as well as some interesting ideas about
using Windows Direct Sound capabilities.  Funny, a couple of years ago
Cubic seemed to be dead in the water.  Nice to see it refreshed and revived...
Well worth checking out any of the following sites for Cubic schtuff:

http://www.thepentagon.com/cubic

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/music/programs/players/iplay122.zip

AFAIK, this player is still there but note that Hornet is disappearing
shortly and almost all of these kinds of files will revert back to the cdrom
FTP site.
  
* Dual Module Player 4.0

  	DMP plays MOD/NST, STM/S3M, 669, FAR, MTM and AMF on PAS16, SB16,
        SB Pro, GUS, GUS MAX, Windows Sound System. Has software filters
        (reverb/echo,lowpass)and quality mode, supports both flavours of
        MOD and S3M stereo panning, now has a 'handy module file selector'.
        Archiver support has been removed in v4.00. The overall accuracy
        of DMP's playback seems to have improved a great deal. Careware
        and/or cardware. By Otto Chrons.

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/music/programs/players/dmp400.zip

Once again, note that the file is contained now on the cdrom FTP site, not
Hornet.  Hornet is still in the process of shutting itself down forever but
the site is still active as of Jan 1999.  More on this subject in section
[6.4].   The following list of players are still available through the Hornet
section of cdrom.com but who knows how much longer that will last.  None of
these programs were checked as per playability etc, so make sure ya really
want it...!

* Genmod v1.3 

     for DOS converts MOD, S3M, MTM, 669, FAR, MED, STM & ULT music files to
     the new .GDM format &  then plays elegent stereo music thru a variety of 
     sound cards (GUS, SB1x, SB2x, SBPro, and PAS) Includes setup and music 
     format conversion utilities. Register and get a 2 disk set with ZIP 
     support/more and free audio CD player. 


* Universal Module Player 

     By Terry Chatman aka void of i.TECH : Some consider this THE module 
     player. Supports XM, S3M, MOD, STM, 669, MTM, SB, SBPro, SB16, PAS, PAS 
     plus, PAS16, GUS. Has very nice graphical views and TONS of new features.

This section was updated in January 1998 by Carsten Stiller <carsten.stiller

* Digital Music Player 1.3 

        Keith Murray dodger@peak.org Digital Music Player is a native, 
        multithreaded OS/2 Presentation Manager application that plays 
        MODs, MIDs, WAVs, AVIs, and any other format thatMultiMedia 
        Presentation Manager/2 (MMPM/2) supports. Supports any soundcard 
        that works with OS/2 (which is most). DMPlayer can play sounds 
	at a maximum of 16-bit 44.1kHz stereo output. Output is placed in a 
        buffer to keep the music playing during high system activity, and
        contains priority management to increase priority when the buffer
        drops below a specified point, and drop it down when the buffer is
        increased. DMPlayer plays from a songlist, which supports drag-n-
        drop and saveable songlists with a variety of sort and display
        options. The songlist can contain any playable format, as well
        as archived files. DMPlayer comes set up for gzip and zip files,
        but any archiver that can extract files to standard output is
        supported.

	DMPlayer's main screen looks like a CD player, with a songlist,
        buffer size, current and total tracks, and song title. DMPlayer
        contains a sub-panel for adjusting the volume, balance, bass and
        treble for drivers that support it.   An info panel displays the
        sample names/message, module format and source filename.

        DMPlayer supports 4 track, 31 and 15 instrument Protracker/Noisetracker
	modules, 4 and 8 track Startrekker modules and 6 and 8 track Fasttracker
        modules.

	The shareware version can't save the settings or playlists, registration 
        is $25 and the key is sent back via EMail.

	Eric Lowe <ericl@erinet.com> wrote on 18 April 95:

        DMP v4 (see section 3.4) runs correctly under OS/2. I use DMP32.EXE,
        though DMP will run too, just not as well. The catch is that you
        can't run DMP32.EXE from an icon directly, for some reason OS/2
        doesn't recognize it as a valid executable, so I created a dummy
        batch file DMP32S.BAT that I put in an icon that just shells and
        runs DMP32. In fact, DMP32 runs better under OS/2 in a VDM than
        the native Presentation-Manager DMPlayer and supports a heck of
        a lot more formats.

And finally Snowman (Christopher G. Mann) r3cgm@cdrom.com wrote in March 1998:

        "I use it under FreeBSD all the time too so you might want to
        mention that.  :)"

        Ftp to hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/mmedia/music/mod for more info on these
        OS/2 proggies.  This is their index at the time of writing...

Well, what was that index is now, or so it appears, no more.

Once again finding almost anything music related in OS2 is a very
disheartening task, MikMOD being almost the only real contender.
(See next section for more..).  While trying to gain information, I
visited several highly touted OS2 sites (all of which were at least
6 months or more likely, 2 years out of date).  I'm sure there is
more OS2 stuff than this, but I don't use that OS - you guys do!
Maybe you'd like to tell me?.

        ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/mikmod-3.1.2.tar.gz

Runs under Linux and Irix without problems. On Irix it is necessary to run mikmod
with the -d1 option.

* MIKIT 0.91

	 MikIt plays IT (also IT2.14 files), XM, S3M, MOD. Playlist support 
	 and more.

MikIT and MikMOD have to be two of the most ported (multi-platform) MOD
players around. in almost every format known to computers geeks, so you
should find one version to fit your system.  Here's a very good MikMak
information page:

http://www.freenet.tlh.fl.us/~amstpi/mikmod.html
 
and a very good MikIT selection for all platforms...

 http://www.stack.nl/~mikmak/mikit.htm

* MOD4X 0.2.0 BETA
 
	Mod4X is a neat XForms based module player build around MikMod engine.
        The modules are played via /dev/dsp. It supports the following types of 
	modules : MOD, MTM, S3M, XM, ULT, UNI, STM. It supports playlist 
	management. It has a user interface very similar to a CD Player.   
	
	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/Mod4X.0.2.0.BETA.tar.gz

This is a very good site for Linux audio apps, well worthy of a browse.  You
may even pick up a program you were not aware of...

* Tracker 4.31

  	This is a fully-fledged protracker/soundtracker module player that is 
	mostly portable. It now runs successfully on the Amiga, Silicon Graphics, 
	Sparc, Linux...

  	ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/misc/unix/tracker-4.31.tar.Z

With the current upsurge of interest in Linux, I have fond hopes of its
adopting large parts of the MOD scene.  An anarchic interface in an anarchic
musical environment.  Grreeeaaatttt!   So?  What about it Linux'ers?
Where's the beef?  And that new tracker... :-)

[3.7] Windows

The biggest change in player availability has to have taken place in Bill
Gates favorite cash cow.  Please understand that this is NOT a complete list
of 'doze players - that would take waay to long....  Just what I believe to
be the better (ie less likely to crash ones).  If I've missed out your player,
why not send me insulting email to tell me what a dick I am :-)  In other words,
show me that great player you made!!

* Mod4win 

        Plays MOD/STM/S3M/669/FAR/MTM/UNIS/OKT/WOW/XM on a Windows asynchronous 
	wave driver (no PC speaker) or GF1- (GUS/MAX/ACE) or OPL4-based card 
	(direct support). Direct to Disk Recording is also available (WAV 
	recording of a mod). Up to 16 bits, 48kHz. Features surround sound (also 
	with GF1 for mods with up to 8 tracks), IDO2, panning, integrated file 
	selection, playlists, file management and archiver support. Perhaps the 
	most accurate player for PC's. A 'light' archive is available, which 
	contains only the English help file and only one example mod to save 
	download time.By Kay Bruns, Uwe Zaenker and Jens Puchert. Shareware $30 
	(new user fee, update prices range from free to $15), runs for 30 days.

        http://www.mod4win.com/
  
This is the *official* M4W website so they should have any or all of the versions
available.  While checking out this link I pulled this information off that site:

Current available Beta versions: (Page last updated 12/11/98)
*	MOD4WIN 2.40 beta 32
*	MOD4WIN 2.40 beta 32 (With new color 'skin' like WinAmp!)
*	MOD4WIN 2.40 MCI device driver 

You can also get it at these FTP sites:

You will not be able to get these for very much longer on the Hornet site,
which is why I list the cdrom addresses.

* Yamp 3.2 (Yet Another Mod Player)

	Windows Mod Player by Andre' Karwath aka AKA This very decent and
        good looking player supports WAVs in all formats, even compressed ,
        MIDs, RMIs, MODs, S3Ms, XMs,ITs and CDs, ZIP support, excellent
        play lists, Drag'n'Drop for songs, play lists, folders and best
        of all...loadable and editable designs!  Even non-rectangular
        windows are possible with this feature (TIP: Try the corner or
        triangular shapes!), hundreds of  designs in great glowing
        colour are included.
        Yamp is freeware.

* XM-Play 1.4

        " XMPlay is a Windows 9x/NT music module player, supporting the XM/
          IT / MOD / S3M / MTM formats. Initially, only XM files were supported
          hence the name "XMPlay"

Or at least, that's what Ian Luck says of his player.  He goes on to add..

        "So, what's so good about XMPlay then?", you ask. It's got the best
        (most accurate to FT2) XM reproduction to be heard from any player.
        All features/effects (including several FT2 quirks) are 100% supported.
        The IT reproduction is also practically balls-on, with full support for
        all effects/NNA/DCA/filters/etc...

Ya know what?  Can't find a fault in this brilliant little player yet.  It's
certainly the most accurate XM player I've ever heard, and I would believe
the same to be true of it's IT emulation. Sample interpolation, built in EQ,
Surround Sound, Volume/Pan ramping, writes WAV's, loads track lists and so on.
The display can be a bit awkward to get to grips with but XM-Play is worth the
write up. From the makers of XM-Exe, another very useful XM based product.

        All products are freeware

[3.8] Apple II GS

This section initially supplied by Peter F. Handel (Zelix)<handel@stolaf.edu>,
with special thanks to Ian Schmidt (IRSMan) <irsman@drift.winternet.com>,
Kris Olsen <olsenk@stolaf.edu> and Frank M. Lin (PoTTy) <fmlin@ccnet.com>.

This section was read through and updated by Carsten Stiller <carsten.stiller
@rz.tu-ilmenau.de> who found that the programs hadn't changed but most of the
URLS had...the version numbers can consequently not be relied upon.  Check out
ftp://ground.isca.uiowa.edu/apple2/apple16/Music/Applics for the latest news.
Once again, if there is an Apple user out there who wants to set the record
straight, get in touch: rebriffr@netcomuk.co.uk

Like a lot of the smaller OS's the Apple seems to suffering under the Windows
onslaught too.  Finding reliable up-to-date information is an increasingly
frustrating exercise.  There's a little ray of hope insofar as the iMac being
able to emulate an Apple when necessary - but that's probably still a feverish
gleam in some programmers eye...  The above link has now been changed to:

ftp://ground.icaen.uiowa.edu

This archive bears the following message, which should hold out some hope for
all you Apple users:

        "This Apple// archive exists because people all across the internet
         raised the funds to buy the 1.7gig disk this archive uses".

Kewl eh?  The site looks quite full, although being a 'Doze user, I have no
idea whether any of the files may be of use to an Apple MOD fan.  Although
there doesn't appear to be a /music directory on the main site you can find
one in each of the /Apple8 and /Apple16 directories.  Just a quick browse
through those directories shows /demos, /songs and /utils and a further
search brought up Noise Tracker, Synth Lab and Sound Smith in the /songs
directory...

The Apple IIGS is equipped with the Ensoniq 5503 chip, the 8-bit predecessor
to the GF-1 and 5506 chips found in modern PC soundcards like the Gravis
Ultrasound and Ensoniq Soundscape.

* MODZap v00.90b3 

	One of the best mod players available for the Apple IIGS. It boasts
        such features as a half screen oscilloscope, full screen oscilloscope
        (for people with a Zip Chip accelerator), and a 4-Channel "QuadraScope".
        Also has option for a graphic-less display, good for multitasking. Arguably
        the best sounding mod player, supporting nearly all effects. By Ian Schmidt 
	<irsman@drift.winternet.com>.
  
        ftp://ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/2/apple2/apple16/Music/Applics/Modzap.v090b3/mz90b3.shk

* NoiseTracker
	
	One of the more interesting mod players. Originally by Oliver Goguel
        and the FTA (Free Tools Association), 1WSW has released further
        "updates" (1.3, 1.4, 2.0). Many programmers have disassembled these
        so-called "updates" and have found little to no  modification to the
        actual code, often changes actually harming sound quality.  Most
        people recommend sticking with v1.10.    This program runs under
        8-bit mode, is written completely without tools, and therefore does
        not adhere to the Apple Human Interface. This program has a lot of
        Easter Eggs! By Oliver Goguel.

        ftp://ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/2/apple2/apple16/Music/Applics/Noisetracker.v140/

* ShellPlay v0.71
	
	Approximately equal to MODZap in sound quality.  As the name implies,
        this player runs from any shell (like the Apple IIGS's UNIX flavor-
        Gno, or	ORCA/M) and works well in the background (even with a high-
        speed modem connection). By Brian Bening.

        ftp://ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/2/apple2/apple16/Music/Applics/Shellplay.v071/shellplay0.71

* soniqTracker v0.6.3 

	The only desktop program that comes close to ModZAP Features include a 
	soniqAlarm, that plays a mod or list of mods at a selected time.  Display 
	is similar to MODZap's full screen oscilloscope.  The source for 
	soniqTracker was recently released to the public. By Tim Meekins 
	<meekins@crl.com>.

        ftp://ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/2/apple2/apple16/Music/Applics/Soniqtracker.v063/

* Sonobox 

	A new mod player based roughly on shellPlay, but with a NDA (New Desk 
	Accessory) interface, making mod music available to just about any GS/OS 
	application that adheres to the "Apple Human Interface". By Tony Morales.

        ftp://ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/2/apple2/apple16/Music/Applics/

I include just the main music directory here because it is definitely worth the
browse, there's even a WaveLab v10 in there!  I doubt, however, whether is
has anything to do with the WaveLab recently issued by Steinberg.   Because
Carsten (in the 1998 update) uses a linux system, none of the software mentioned
was tested and we accordingly have to go by the original reviews.  Once again,
any Apple help here would be most appreciated

[4] Creating Mods

If you've skidded here from the index, let me make one thing clear.  To get a
real understanding of the subject, you really *should* read all the relevant
parts of this FAQ before suffering online by asking a 'dumb' question.  Like
all of us, I'd rather dive straight in than read any manual but most everything
I finally learned about MODs and tracking actually did come from a good dose
of  RTFM's!   There any many good - if not extraordinary - tutorial sites on
the web that really help to close the distance between learning and doing.
Most people who started tracking when I did (ie 1992 or so) had to gain that
knowledge by massive amounts of trial and error - it's nice to see that doesn't
hold true anymore.

So, you're all fired up by hearing a couple of tracks that drive you wild, and
you want to compose a couple of your own miesterwerks?   This is where the
essential tracking ingredient comes in - the MOD tracker (or MOD editor as
it's sometimes known).

MODs come in a bewildering array of formats and styles.  The bigger the scene
gets, the more kit there seems to be that goes with it.  The most important
thing with all the trackers we are about to cover is to understand that you
really should *read* the manuals.  Yeah, yeah, I know... Banging on about
that again, ain't I?  Well, there really is no other way...

Actually, there *is* another way, and it's almost as effective as RTFM's.  

Download as many different MODs as your harddrive/modem can stand and *study*
them.  What made a composer use this effect, or that pan.  What made them
choose particular types of samples?  You can learn a lot by studying and
duplicating moves you've seen other trackers do.

Before all this, you'll need the tracker...and here they are...

[4.1.1] Amiga

This section originally supplied by Steven Innell <spi@dcs.qmw.ac.uk> on Thu,
24 Nov 94, updated/corrected by Sir Fitz <sirfitz@kaiwan.com> on Fri, 10 Feb
95: and comments from jester (Tobias Reckhard) jester@fmr.maschinenbau.tu-
darmstadt.de between 1994-1996.

This section was checked for changes and new information by Steve Gilmore
rebriffr@netcomuk.co.uk in April 1998 and Jan 1999.

The Amiga scene staggers on, with the invaluable help of the Aminet network.
And, like all the smaller OS's, there is a distinct lessening of sites catering
to this machine.  On this update, this is what I found...

* Protracker V3.15 ( / V3.10b - see the note below)

	Probably the most used tracker until recently (ie 1994) (with people
        using versions of Octamed in preference). This tracker is the most
        up-to-date mod creator for the amiga, based on the original Soundtracker
        interface (although highly upgraded). This version was re-written by
        Cryptoburners, and has plenty of editing options including simple sample
        manipulation (sampling,	reverb, reverse, cut/paste etc.), but, as of yet,
        does not have a midi option, nor does it support any form of synthetic
        sound generation. It does however have an option for using 14-bit samples,
        although these are few and far between.

	It is a daunting program to use at first, especially if you have never had 
	the experience of using any tracker on the amiga (e.g. Soundtracker/
	Noisetracker/Protracker V1-2.3), since this version uses the sample effect 
	commands found in those older version...and unlike the older versions, 
	this does not have on-line help listing the effects, and what they do.

	Protracker is Freeware, with no form of registration/shareware fees to
        be paid. A new version (3.20) was supposed to be out, but as of yet I
        have been unable to find it. 

        http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/aminet/mus/edit/Protracker3.61.lha

        On Wed, 17 May 1994, Markus Weichselbaum contacted jester, saying
	(excerpt):

	"The last official version was PT3.10b, available on ftp.funet.fi.
        PT315 is an internal version never meant to be released (...). PT3.15
        has been removed from Aminet, however there is a PT2.3 available.
        There are simply no '14-bit' samples released. The so-called 'DYN
        14bit' system was working to some extent, but since the 'DYN' system
        was entirely rewritten, the development of PT315 was stopped. Only 2
        or 3 test mods have been released, but no samples or documentation (...).
        I recommend use of PT310b which essentially has the same features as
        PT315. PT310 is indeed freeware, but PT3.15 is NOT."

	When I (jester) asked Steven Innell about this, he replied (excerpt):
 	"I've had the program for 2 years. (...) I know U4IA, who once was a 
	member of Cryptoburners, and also tested a lot of the original trackers 
	out, and he has never said that PT3.15 was a leaked version never
        intended for release...in fact, a while back he told me they were
        working away on a commercial V4."

	Finally, on 28 Sep 1995, Steven Innell mentioned the subject again,
        saying (excerpt): ".. and I can now confirm that the release of most
        of the V3 series were not intended to be available as soon as they
        were (the exception being V3.00).  However the programmer of V3.15
        didn't seem to be worried (...) that PT was available, ... BTW,
        V3.10 is very unstable and unusable on accelerated machines but if
        you (or anyone else) feel that V3 should not be available,  then
        the next best valid release that works is V2.3b AGA, which was
        fixed to run on AGA machines."

	Now, all I (jester) have to say is that I don't mind anyone using 
	whichever version they wish and I hope the above, especially the last 
	note, clears up any confusion that may have been created.

All of the above has been in this FAQ since (it seems) its inception, I've
spoken to jester about it.  But, as usual, I came away no wiser;-)  I think
jester and I talked about deleting it but then I thought, what the hey...
It's all grist to someone's mill somewhere..  In the meantime, I'm still
looking for that elusive Amiga user who can make this section a hell of a lot
clearer to us all...

* OctaMed 

	Several changes have been made to the program, the first and most
        notable	being that OctaMed now opens its screen on the WorkBench
        screen, using whatever ScreenMode was being used by the WB. Amongst
        the many features added are better/or new SoundCard support (Aura/
        Tocatta) improved 8 channel handling, completely new interface (as
        mentioned above - sortof)

	The New features are numerous, and if you are a med fan, you are
        advised to download the demo of Version 6 from Aminet, and read the
        large text documentation that comes with it. Note that OctaMed is a
        Commercial program, and can be purchased from Ray Burt-Frost Software
        at:

I received this information from Ray Burt Frost in February 1998:

*	OctaMED Soundstudio V1.03c
 
	This is the 1996/7 release version of this series of Trackers by
        Teijo Kinnunen.

	Several changes have been made to the program, the first and most
        notable	being that OctaMED now opens its screen on the Workbench
        screen, using whatever Screen Mode was being used by the WB. Amongst the
        many features added are better/or new Soundcard support,improved 8
        channel handling, no sample size limits, plus a *lot* more!

        OctaMED Soundstudio is a Commercial Program, although V1.03c
	has now been designated as Freeware and the full version is
        available from:

 	http://www.octamed.co.uk/

        OctaMED Soundstudio V2 Beta and OctaMED Soundstudio V1.03c Freeware
        version are both available at this site as is the 1.03c's online
        manual.  Some FAQ`s about the program can be found on the sites
        AMIGA pages.   The earlier "OctaMED" V4 can also be downloaded for
        those with older 0/S as well as at Aminet's OctaMED archive as
        of 1/16/99:

        Octa5.lha               A demo of Octamed5 
        OctaMED.lzh             Music editor, can handle 8 voices

        omed_pt15.lha           OctaMED SS1 PT cuts upgrade (1.5)

* StarTrekker 1.2

	This is a mod editor in the same vein as Octamed. It has a layout
        the same as the old sound/noisetrackers, but also has the ability
        to use 8 channels...however 8 channel mode sounds really bad, and
        you are better off using octamed, or protracker.

        StarTrekker.lha 134K Version 1.2 of StarTrekker can now be found at 

        http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/mus_edit.html
        http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/aminet/mus/edit/StarTrekker.lha
        or by FTP at: 
        ftp://ftp.aminet.org/

* Future Composer 

	This is a wholly synthetic mod editor (saying that..it does allow
        the use	of samples). It does not import/export tracker mods though.
        This program is very old (1989 ish) and is very fiddly to use..even
        with the manual printed out and in front of me. The tunes this tracker
        generates sound a lot like the 8-bit machines tunes (eg C64 music).
        Some of the tunes are however very nice sounding, its just a shame
        the program is so damn hard to use ;-)

        FutureComposer.lha 210K Editor for BSI Future Composer mods can now
        be found at

        http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/aminet/mus/edit/FutureComposer.lha
        or 
        ftp://ftp.aminet.org/

* Art Of Noise

        This is a recent mod Editor for the Amiga. It is a shareware demo of
        the program, the full version costing 79 DM (available only from the
        author). First of all, it is 100% protracker compatible (load-format!)
        That means, that you don't have to get used to new shortcuts to old
        (protracker)  functions! But that doesn't mean, that this tracker is
        just another protracker clone!  You might already have noticed, that
        AON has got dozens of new functions. If you load AON for the first
        time, you might be slayed by all these new functions, but it's worth
        taking a look at them. I think  it would be the best to list up a few
        of them:

		- OS-2 graphical environment !  Reqtools-Requester !
		- Supports euro-72 monitors !!
		- 8 channels! But in contrary to startrekker/octamed/oktalyzer
                  this time REAL 8 channels, that means free volume/pitch-settings
                  on EVERY channel, loops of course also possible (achieved by
                  real-time Mixing of channels)
		- maximum number of instruments increased to 61 !
		- maximum number of patterns increased to 128 !
		- maximum number of positions increased to 256, including restart 
                  position !!
		- wavetable & sampleinstruments.
		- 'macro' instruments possible: E.g. 10 instruments can share
                  the same waveform, but the samplestart (for example, there is
                  certainly a greater number of possibilities offered by this
                  feature!) can vary from instrument to instrument ! Wavetable
                  instruments can be used to create 64er-like sounds, but they
                  are also great for big resonance-pads etc. !!
		- number of player-commands increased from 28 (protracker) to 45 ! 
                  and there are of course a lot to come in future versions !
		- Supports powerpacker and STONECRACKER (the best cruncher around!)
		- Arpeggio (maximal 7 notes!) + any other effect, arpeggio speed
                  changeable
                - Remark (normal textfile/ansi) linkable to module !!
		- FM-Synthesis !
		- Drumsequencer! Make your own drumlines with up to 16 tracks !!
		- Big sampleeditor ! Features samples>128k, multisampling, sample-
                  trigger digital-filter with selectable depth, flanger, phase-     
                  distortion, direct 'freestyle' sample editing: paint your own
                  waves!
                - supports external-synchronizing, e.g. for demos or other presentations
		- Player is easy to build in in own programs.
		- Turbo-Player available, takes about 1-2 rasterlines (faster than 
                  any other player!)

                The whole handling has been changed of course, so just check
                out the preview If you like this program, please don't copy it.
                A program worth using is a program worth buying ! Contact me at
                the following address:
	
		BASTIAN SPIEGEL
		TRUPERMOORER LANDSTRASSE 17A
		28865 LILIENTHAL
		GERMANY
                or call: 04298-30731 or 04298-4873 (16h-22h) (if other line
                is busy or nobody picks up)

                The full-version will cost 79DM and features a very nice printed
                manual plus 4 disks (program/workshop/instruments/demomods) !

                The preview version lacks save routines, but all effects and
                functions are useable!

Be warned, however, that this file doesn't seem to have received an update
since Feb '95  That obviously doesn't bode well for the program, let alone
all the blurb above.  Anyone have any further info on this tracker, please
contact me.  I also recieved this infomation from Patrick Meng <pmeng@vtx.ch>
as I was compiling the 1998 version of this FAQ:

* Symphonie

        8BIT;RIFFWAV 16BIT; AIFF 8/16BIT / STEREO/MONO: max. 256 samples (only
        in editor, but File format (DBM) supports max 65535); max.1024 patterns;
        max. 1024 positions; almost all key shorcuts and commands are Pro Tracker
        compatible; ping pong loop and command E3x - backward play; realtime
        instrument effects:volume envelope; boost envelope; filter envelope;
        offsets; panning envelope and much more.

The website http://www.amigaworld.com/support/digibooster/ is about the only
site I can locate for this...and even that says it's shutting down.  Yet
another vapourware tracker anyone?

[4.1.2] Atari ST

Thanks to Dan <cs93dlh@dcs.ex.ac.uk> for this original information.  Note: To
the best of Dan's knowledge, the programs mentioned here can be downloaded via
ftp from ftp://atari.archive.umich.edu/ and its mirrors. Using the same
address in any browser should also allow you access.

        Atari ST: There is a port of ProTracker from the Amiga. This will
        allow you to create 4-track MODs.

        Atari STE/TT/Mega STE: To create mods on these machines, you
        basically have a choice of two programs - ProtrackerSTE or
        Octalyser

    	ProtrackerSTE is an upgraded port of ProTracker from the Amiga.
        It handles only 4 tracks, but has the full PT command set and
        gives good quality playback. (Note there are also a bundle of
        PT clones for these machines,such as Esion)

    	Octalyser is an 8-track tracker. You need a fast STE or a TT
        to playback all 8 tracks though. Octalyser will let you create
        or play back 4, 6 or 8 track mods. It will load many different
        mod formats, but not S3M or MTM.  Sound quality is quite good.

        Atari Falcon030: For creating mods on this machine, there are
        basically three main choices:

    	Octalyser (mentioned above) has drivers for the enhanced sound
        system, thus giving good quality playback, but only 4, 6 and 8
        track mod formats, not S3M or MTM.

    	MegaTracker - 32 track tracker. All tracker commands and practically
        all mod formats are supported including S3M and MTM. Unbelievable
        speed and quality are produced by the DSP mixing. Unfortunately, the
        instructions have not yet been translated from french, but it is only
        a matter of time.

    	Digital Tracker - 32 track tracker. Supports almost all tracker
        commands and formats, although it hangs on some S3Ms. this is
        commercial software and only a demo is available, which has certain
        restrictions.

The following updated 1999 information was supplied by the wonderful efforts
of frustrated Atari owner James Smith jimsmith@zetnet.co.uk who contacted me
on absm complaining about the lack of Atari playable MODs.  He found this
tracker, and few other bits and pieces (see players)....

* DBE Tracker

        It is worth noting that this is the newest multichannel tracker for
        the ST. Unlike Mega and Graumf Trackers, DBE will run on ALL Atari
        machines and will attempt to play up to 32 channels on any of them.
        Obviously there is a serious loss of quality on lower spec machines...
        A demo of the programme is available from many Atari sources and it
        can be registered with the author (Denis Huget) for about 6 UK
        pounds. Updates are provided on a regular basis to registered users.

        http://sectorone.atari.org

        One mod format not supported by any Atari trackers/players is .IT -
        I have asked Denis to add it to DBE !!

I checked that the original links still worked but I couldn't connect to
ftp://atari.archive.umich.edu/atari/Music/ so I wasn't able to verify any
Atari information. Any further Atari help would be most appreciated...but
I nosed around a bit more so try these sites..

[4.1.3] Mac

This section was originally written by Barry Nathan <barryn@netcom.com> 
and Rich "Akira" Pizor <pizor@lclark.edu>. The updated information was
compiled from Glen Warner's efforts...and checked by Steve Gilmore
<rebriffr@netcomuk.co.uk>

Barry Nathan <barryn@netcom.com> wrote on Thu, 17 Nov 1994:

* Player Pro

        Player Pro 4.5: Can access the sound chip directly, so it takes
        less processor time than SoundTrecker. It'll still work when new
        Macs with new sound chips come out, because it can also use the
        regular Sound Manager  3.0 if necessary, like when the PowerMacs
        came out and Player Pro didn't support their sound chip. Only
        edits its own format, MADF, but it can import and export MOD,
        S3M, MIDI, XM, 669, OKTA and MED (as of version 4.5 the S3M
        import filter is out of beta stage). Version 4.5 also supports
        multiple samples in one instrument.   PlayerPro has a very
        mixed track record for some of its more obscure import and
        tracking options, but reportedly plays many of the basic mod
        formats better than the other Mac heavyweight, Sound-Trecker
        2.2. PlayerPro is shareware and until you pay the $20
        registration fee, most tracking/editing features are turned
        off (including import and save) and it will automatically quit
        after having been open for 20 minutes.  A CD-ROM version is also
        available for $40, which comes with a library of mods and
        instrument samples. Upgrades are free, except for the upgrade from
        the disk to the CD-ROM version,which will cost $20 for an upgrade.
        Unlike Sound-Trecker, it is fully PowerMac-native, which means it
        FLIES by on a PowerMac.

        http://www.quadmation.com/pphome.htm
        
        Barry <barryn@netcom.com> added:  "partially, but not fully, PMac
        native, but it can do simulated surround sound for headphones or (I
        think...) Dolby Surround decoders. However, with the Surround option,
        the fact that it's not fully native really shows, as you hear clicks
        when you try to do other stuff. However, the slowdown isn't that
        severe on normal Macs. The two other advantages are that it can
        play (Okta)MEDs, which Player Pro can't handle, and some MODs play
        better with it than Player Pro. Keep in mind that with the extra
        features and bug fixes with Player Pro 4.2, most MODs play -much-
        better with Player Pro, though, and PP is cheaper."

        Rich "Akira" Pizor adds: Sound-Tracker is a shell program which plays
        formats based on plug-ins, providing for maximum flexibility, since
        plug-ins can easily be written whenever a new format is introduced.
        Currently, most of the standard 4- and 8-track MOD formats are
        supported. Also available is a plug-in that makes it PowerPC native.
        It is also known for having one of the better interfaces of Mac MOD
        players. The resources for creating/editing MODs are present, yet
        the appropriate menu items are dimmed. I've not met anyone who
        could explain this anomaly to me. The two theories I've heard are
        that you get editing capabilities if you register the program
        (German ReadMe not too well understood) or that the resources
        are simply sitting there while the author learns how to integrate
        the corresponding features into a later release of the program.
 
Glen Warner then stirs that mystery soup into the following (more relevant)
info:

* PlayerPRO 5.02 

        Major changes include --

        - Optimized for G3 processors and System 8.5
        - 'Find and Replace' implemented (as in 'Find' all notes on This track with That sample')
        - Documentation updated (.pdf format) <-- read it!
        - New QuickTime-based (optional) file format
        - Consolidated audio controls into one window ("Mixer")
        - Supports 255 instruments
        - Supports up to 254 tracks ("limited to 99 for GUI reasons")
        - Two separate versions:
          (1) a 'freeware' version
          (2) a 'full' version

        The full version is not available as of Feb99, but you can submit your
        order at the web page. The 'freeware' version is intended for universal
        distribution (web sites, BBSes, CD-ROMs, etc.) and will only play .MOD
        and .MADx formatted files. You can never upgrade it to the full version.
        The version I tested quit after 20 minutes of playing (I complained to
        the programmer about this, and suspect it is fixed in the current
        version).

        The 'full' version will not be downloadable anywhere; you must buy
        the CD ...and yes, there *has* been a price drop: it is no longer US
        $100, but US $69. There should be an even cheaper upgrade price,
        according to the documentation that comes with the freeware version.

        Supports .MOD, S3M, MIDI, MTM, MADx, OKTA, XM, XI, MED, 669, IT,
        and ULT. For samples, supports System 7 sounds,  .WAV and AIFF
        formats (use SoundApp to convert from other formats to one of the
        above sound formats).

        Now, for the bad news ....

        - Still no IT 2.14 ('compressed') support (but he's working on it)
        - The freeware version opens rather slowly on my PowerBook 1400cs/166.
          Have not downloaded and tested on an iMac as yet (soon, though), but
          I suspect it will fly.
        - New minimum system specs: PowerMac running System 8.0 or higher
        - Still somewhat pricey, but on the other hand, it's cheaper than it used
          to be.
        - The freeware version will overwrite your original PlayerPRO prefs file;
          keep your registration number handy!
        - If you don't upgrade to the full version, don't throw out 4.59; you
          can't compose in the freeware version.
 	- There will be no port to Windows (beyond the simple player available
          now).

        Bottom Line:

        Looks good, runs a little slow (on my system, anyway; G3's should be
        fine). If you are a registered user, aren't using a PowerMac and
        actually use PlayerPRO to produce your own music, keep version 4.5.9
        handy since you can't compose with the freeware version.

* MacMod Pro

        Barry Nathan <barryn@netcom.com> wrote: "is now in version 4.15 and
        has received a MAJOR overhaul. The staff editor works and it works
        pretty well, though it takes a little getting used to. One nice
        feature is the ability to record in realtime from the soft keyboard,
        a feature which isn't (to the best of my [editor's note: this is
        Akira's] knowledge) supported by any other Mac tracker. It supports
        anywhere from 4-32 channels and up to 39 instruments. It also allows
        you to set preferences linking it to specific directories for various
        files, so when you try to load a new instrument or mod or file, it
        goes straight to the appropriate directory, rather than having the
        user navigate to the right place. S3M support has been promised
        since version 3.0.1, but the format is unsupported as of version
        4.15.

        jester then notes: There is no confirmed information about MacMod
        Pro's native file format yet (I suppose Akira simply forgot to
        mention it). I also *assume* the program marketing status hasn't
        changed, so here's the information from the last FAQ revision:]
        MacMod Pro is shareware.  A $25 registration fee is required to
        unlock the Save option, but all other functions work off the shelf,
        so you can get a good feel for how the program works and for what
        it takes to make a mod.

        This was the news as of January 30, 1998 at the MacMod site:

        MacMod Pro 5.11 is now available. Version 5.11 fixes a few problems
        that sneaked int the 5.1 release. MacMod Pro now comes packaged in a
        convenient installer. This installer can copy your registration from
        an older copy of MacMod Pro.

Glen Warner writes in 1999:

MacMod Pro has been updated to version 5.2. Testing in progress. Initial
impressions: it has been updated to work with MacOS 8.5, and there have been
a few bug-fixes. Scrolling in the (G-cleft) editor is as smooth as the
previous version. Ships with the same songs, also. Definitely worth a look.
US $25 shareware.

[4.1.4] MS-DOS

jester <jester@fmr.maschinenbau.tu-darmstadt.de> wrote in an earlier FAQ: 

	"MS-DOS users have quite a few trackers available to them nowadays,
        with capabilities superior to first-generation mods".  

Obviously that has continued apace although judging by the proliferation of
Windows based trackers, these existing progs are gonna have a really hard
time surviving.  Microsloth seems bound and determined to rid the world of
DOS forever, to be replaced by paving of a Windoze variety.  Surprises
still though, as Cubic makes a welcome re-appearance - apparently rejuvenated!

The descriptions and URLs of these programs was compiled and checked by M.
Linus Larsen linus.larsen@mbox200.swipnet.se for the 1998 update.  His notes
follow most descriptions.

* Scream Tracker 3.21 

        Programmed by PSI of Future Crew. Supports GUS, SB, SB Pro. Edits
        up to 32 digital tracks (but plays only up to 16), 99 instruments
        (S3M format supports 255), features a superset of the ProTracker
        command set (but some effects are handled a little different),
        8 bit samples with adjustable C4Spd (S3M format allows for 16 bit
        ADPCM packed stereo samples), 9 Adlib FM channels (only playable on
        SB or SB Pro) and 8 octaves. Features separate volume column (and
        track panning available in most players). Extensive block commands
        and editing capabilities make this one of the best trackers around
        nowadays. Version 3.2 is extensively bugfixed over the previous
        release. Writes in S3M and MOD formats (but S3M to MOD conversion
        is NOT recommended!). Reads S3M, STM (perfect), M.K., 6CHN, 8CHN,
        Oktalyzer MOD, 5 to 10 track MOD (pretty good MOD loader) and a
        proprietary import format. Has an own sample format, which it
        shares with Advanced Digiplayer, but ST3 can also read raw 8-bit
        samples (signed and unsigned). MOD samples (signed 8-bit) can be
        imported by loading a MOD that uses them into ST3 (all information
        is retained). Freeware.

Linus reported a new URL:

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/music/programs/trackers/scrmt321.zip

Obviously ST has been superceded by Impulse Tracker but it's still a
venerable piece of tracking kit and S3Ms are still being made and
distributed, although in lesser quantities.

* FastTracker II 

        Programmed by Mr H and Vogue of Triton. 

        Supports GUS, SB and SB Pro. Edits up to 32 tracks, 128 instruments,
        multi-sampled instruments (up to 16 samples per instrument), volume
        and panning envelopes for instruments, instrument panning, 4 GB
        maximum sample size,bidirectional looping, variable pattern length,
        built-in sample editor, sampler and CD dumper, 256 patterns, separate
        volume/panning/vibrato column, claims full MIDI support. Imports MOD,
        STM, S3M type mods, GUS patches, raw samples (signed and unsigned) and
        IFF samples and WAVs.  Samples can be 8 or 16 bits. Sample tuning by
        finetune and relative note value.  Shareware $20.
 	
        Fasttracker comes in many varieties; 2.06, 2.08 and now (1999) the new
        version, 2.09. The 2.06 version is still available in lots of sites, as
        is 2.08 which can be found here:

        http://www.starbreeze.com/down/ft208.zip Main Developer these days....
        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/.27/sac/sound/ft208.zip  
        http://sorry.vse.cz/maz/archives/ft209.zip  and a link to Maz's site
        for 2.09.

This is basically an update/bugfix by Andreas Viklund with some new additions.
Just be aware that this is not an official Star Breeze version so it should
be treated with some care.  I haven't had a problem with it so far, but ya
never know.  Best to install it as a new version first - don't overwrite
your original until you are sure it works on your system.  This is not too
say that it's a bad version - far from it.  Just be careful, I've seen lots
of people having problems with FT installation (usually with SB clones)...
A note of further caution for GUS & GUS PnP users: it's probably best you
stick to 2.08 because 2.09 does not appear to work with GUS PnP cards(?!?)

The Fasttracker II Resource Page has changed address and is now at:

* Impulse Tracker 

        Programmed by Pulse (Jeffrey Lim). 

        IT Patch #4 (122 K) allows to use DirectX for sound output, DirectX6
        is Required.  Supports SB16, GUS, SB Pro, SB and PC Speaker. Features
        a Scream-Tracker-3'ish interface.  Edits up to 64 tracks, 99
        instruments, multi-sampled instruments,  volume,panning and pitch
        envelopes, bidirectional looping, 8/16 bit samples with variable C5Spd
        (higher tuning range than ST3). Uses a (slightly altered) superset of
        the S3M commands. IT created the New Note Actions format, now being
        implimented by almost every new tracker.  Imports S3M, MTM, MOD and
        IT type mods, ST3 and IT type samples /instruments (anything else is
        interpreted as raw data). Mod files can be used as instrument libraries.
        Writes IT and S3M files (S3M with restrictions). Non-crippled non-
        obliging shareware.

        Impulse Tracker information can be found at the only surviving official
        Web site HQ:;

        http://www.citenet.net/noise/it

        The latest version (2.14) can also be found at the following site:

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/music/programs/trackers/it214.zip

* Farandole Composer 1.00 

        Programmed by Daniel Potter of Digital Infinity.

	Supports GUS only. Edits 16 tracks, 64 instruments, an own command
        set (does not claim to be PT-compliant), 8 and 16 bit sample support,
        sample size up to 1 Meg, imports MOD, 669, GUD PAT and ST3/Digiplayer
        samples. Features separate volume column and track panning. Loads MOD,
        669, ULT (buggy) mods. Uses SVGA to display all tracks on screen
        simultaneously in 132x50 mode. Has a built-in sample editor. Shareware
        $15. The FAR format is not very well supported (outside this tracker).

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/music/programs/trackers/far100.zip

* UltraTracker v1.6 

        Programmed by MAS of Prophecy. 

	Supports GUS. Edits up to 32 tracks, 8 and 16 bit instruments, variable 
	C2Spd with finetune, bidirectional looping, instrument panning, 255 
	patterns, subset of the PT commands, two effect slots per note. Built-
        in sample editor. Imports S3M, MOD, 669, FAR and MTM mods. Imports IFF,
        PAT,WAV, FSM, SND and raw sample types. Mouse driven. Shareware $20.
        The ULT	format is not very well supported (outside this tracker).

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/music/programs/trackers/ultra160.zip

* ModEdit 

        (current version reported to be v3.01) - programmed by Norman Lin.

	Supports SB, DAC and the internal speaker using Mark J. Cox's playing
	routine (it runs even on 286 PC's). Edits only M.K. format. Mouse-driven
  	menu interface. This editor's main quality is its sort-of-musical
  	notation. Whereas almost all other trackers display the tracks vertically
  	and notes are only discernible by their key character, ModEdit displays
  	the current pattern horizontally and the notes on a vertical spread. This
  	editor is old but could suit some people to get started on. It has a very
  	good documentation, which can unfortunately be a bit misleading at times,
  	however. Shareware $??

You may be wondering why Buzz and other similar kit is not being shown here.
That is because I feel these devices (and I include AXS 2.x) better belong in
the Softsynth section [9.1].  Wanna argue with that decision?  Email

[4.1.6] UNIX (Sun/Linux/NeXt)

Thanks to Andreas Schiffler <andreas@karlsberg.usask.ca> for the following
information:

With the new version of DOSEMU (ver. 0.60.4), quite a number of trackers work
under Linux. As of this version, DOSEMU supports Soundblaster emulation and
basic DMA, which should get most trackers working with it. It is available at

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/emulators/
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/ALPHA/

Carsten Stiller <carsten.stiller@rz.tu-ilmenau.de> supplied this 1998 update
on a new Linux tracker:

* Funktracker Gold 1.0

	A textbased tracker for Unix. It only supports .mod format and the
        internal .fnk format. Plays music over /dev/dsp - no GUS support yet.

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players/FunktrackerGOLD-1.0.tgz

Note this was the ORIGINAL link and it no longer appears to be valid.  So
unless you like staring at 404 messages, best not to click on it.  The
Sunsite Linux Sound libraries seem to be quite full (to my eyes it seemed
to be mostly sound editing stuff).  I know that Funktracker is out there
somewhere because I've seen discussions on it.  Anyone shed some light on
their present whereabouts?

[4.1.7] Windows

        "By far the most active area in tracking software these days is in
        Windows.  It's strange then, that there are still so few Windows
        trackers".

That's what I wrote in the 1998 version of this FAQ and what a difference a
year makes, because here we are up to our eyeballs in new Windows based
trackers.  The best thing about this is that they are not all vapourware!
They actually exist!! :-)

Yep, finally, at last, Windows can be said to contain some very decent trackers
indeed.  Really has to be said that the MODPlug Tracker has improved beyond
all recognition to the early stuff we saw in absm only a couple of short
years ago.  MPT is now a very mature, stable Windows tracker and although it
was arguably first on the scene, it's been joined by MadTracker, Versa Tracker,
et al....  There's still plenty of vapourware out there too with projected
versions of IT3 for Windows, ReTrack (a Windows FT type) and still another
FT3 for Windows!  Whether any of these ever see the light of day, we'll have
to see.  On that front, IT3 looks very promising - at least judging by the
screenshots doing the rounds.

The long awaited PC version of the Amiga favourite OctaMED Sound Studio is
still not known. Alpha (or test) versions of this tracker are downloadable
from the OctaMED site.  At the time of writing, release is set for 3rd Qtr
of 1999.

* Modplug Tracker 

As we were finishing this update this tracker was being released in it's
'final' version 1.4, although it's always best to see the site for more current
versions

        The ModPlug Tracker is a 32-bit Windows 95/NT application,
        featuring a lot of options to create the best possible output

* VersaTracker 1.0 

        Programmed by Khaled Agrama

        VersaTracker has a wonderfully easy interface, anyone familiar with
        MODplug Tracker will recognise Versa Tracker!   This currently
        supports the loading and playing of XM's, S3M's, MOD's, and IT's
        (versions 2.12 and earlier).  However, please take note, editing
        anything other than XM's will not work properly. Full MOD, S3M,
        and IT support are planned for the final release.

        Currently, the tracker downloads with an html file which mentions
        some of the shortcut keys and commands.  This is the only help
        currently available, but hopefully it should be enough to get you
        going.  The tracker has two main sections: the instrument editor
        and the pattern editor, and is easily one of the most intuitive
        Windows tracker currently available.

[4.2] Converters

Jester<jester@fmr.maschinenbau.tu-darmstadt.de> wrote this for the last
update:

Conversion between mod formats and especially conversion from/to non-mod
music file formats is pretty sure to lose some information of the original
piece.

In most of the cases, there is no way around this. You can't, for example,
convert a 16-track S3M using Qxy and excessive volume commands to a 4-track
M.K.. The M.K. just can't hold the information. It is possible, on the other
hand, to convert a M.K. to S3M very accurately. There are a few minor
incompatibilities, but these would hardly be noticeable by many.  Conversions
to and from MIDI are also very difficult to get done right with today's mod
formats. MIDI files, while seemingly similar, have a very different command
set from mods. Only one of the differences is that the MIDI output device
'knows' how to process its sounds when it receives commands from the MIDI
file/player, for example how fast to decay a piano waveform.

This information is not stored in the MIDI file itself, but a mod would have
it included. A converter has no means of asking the MIDI device how it would
handle a certain situation (this is not completely correct, at least when
using a GUS, the patches could be parsed), so it has to assume certain things.
I suppose, however, that better converters could do the trick if they were
programmed for certain situations (I think a converter that creates mod
instruments by itself from a GUS' patches, for example, could accurately
convert from MIDI to an advanced mod format such as S3M, XM or ULT).

But did you want to know any of this?

Once again M. Linus Larsen <linus.larsen@mbox200.swipnet.se> helped to track
down some links and information in this section.

[4.2.1] from MIDI

First, 2 programs from the maker of XMPlay, Ian Luck.

* 2MIDI

        The first 2MIDI beta-release has "expired" and is currently off-line,
        an updated version will be available in early 1999.  (Ed: OK, where
        is it then?) This is what the website had to say about 2MIDI:

        2MIDI is a balls-on accurate MOD to MIDI file converter, it doesn't 
        just stick the notes into a MIDI file. It also converts the effects
        and instrument info (volume/pan envelopes etc...) to make an exact
        MIDI copy of the MOD (assuming there are enough MIDI channels). It
        currently supports XM and MOD files, but other formats are a
        possibility in the future, hence the name "2MIDI" rather than
        "XM2MIDI".

* MID2XM

        MID2XM is a MS-Windows program that, as the title suggests, converts
        MIDI files into XM digital music modules (FastTracker 2 modules).
        The purpose of MID2XM is to make it easier to create quality music
        for demos, games or whatever. By using a MIDI sequencer and
        instrument to record and edit the music before converting it with
        MID2XM to a XM module. Rather than starting from scratch using a
        tracker.  Integrated WAV to XI converter, XM playback in Windows.

Both programs can be obtained from Ian Luck's page at:

http://www.icl.ndirect.co.uk/music/

* PTMID 0.3  

        converts General MIDI files to MOD (i.e. M.K., 6CHN and 8CHN) and
        MTM files. To do this, it relies on a configuration file which
        specifies the samples to be used, the number of tracks to generate
        and the resolution to use. A careful setup is therefore absolutely
        necessary if anything good is going to emerge. The resulting mods
        will generally still require some re-editing in a mod editor. Seems
        like it's freeware.  By Andrew Scott (ascott@tartarus.uwa.edu.au)

        Mac version  (ftp://ftp.mm.se/playerpro/ptmid_0.3_folder.sit.bin). I'll try
        again later.

The reason Linus couldn't get to this file is because it's not an anonymous FTP

==============================================================================

[5] Samples

Jester <jester@fmr.maschinenbau.tu-darmstadt.de> wrote: Samples are of crucial
importance in mods. Good samples make the difference between a quite-good and
a great mod. And since custom samples are one of mods' greatest advantages, a
lot of attention should be paid to a wise choice in samples.

It is important to know the main two qualities a sample has, the resolution,
i.e. number of bits, and its sampling rate. The number of bits in a sample
denote its ability to distinguish between levels of amplitude, a higher number
of bits can grasp a sound more accurately than a low one. The sampling rate is
directly related to the highest frequency that can be reproduced by the sample.
A sample with a sampling rate of 40kHz, for example (kHz means 1000Hz, 1Hz is
one oscillation per second), can reproduce sounds of up to 20kHz. This means
that low sampling rates can be used to reproduce low sounds, but reproduction
of high frequencies (cymbals, but also pianos) require higher sampling rates.
The theory behind this is known as the Nyquist theorem.

Another aspect of mods is the maximum size a sample is allowed to have. This
varies in the file formats from 64 Kilobytes to virtually unlimited size.
Note that some trackers impose harsher limits on sample length than the formats
they output. The solution offered to the sample size problem is sample looping.
Well placed loop points make quite a difference in sustained instruments, so
spend enough time here.

Sample formats seem to be a very confusing subject in the mod community.

Especially SAM and SMP don't seem to be at all well understood. Keep in mind
that filename extensions can be arbitrarily chosen and changed in most operating
systems, so they lose any identifier quality. Thus I consider sample formats
those files which can be identified by some sort of header. SAM and SMP, when
meaning MOD (i.e. M.K., xCHN, FLTx, NST, etc.) samples, do not have any header.
They are simply data assembled in a file. A tracker using them decodes them to
8-bit raw signed sample data. But it assumes a playback rate to be used.
Normally, finetune and loop values can not be stored in MOD samples (Fasttracker
1 circumvents this problem by abusing the file's date and time stamp). The only
safe method to exchange MOD samples is to use these in MOD files and exchange
these (if there are other safe ways on the Amiga or another platform, please
correct me). See section 5.1.3 on how to convert to "SAM format".

[5.1.1] Sampling

This section initially supplied by Andy Church <achurch@goober.mbhs.edu> in
1994.

Andy writes: Although the specific methods used for sampling vary from platform
to platform and program to program, the general procedure is the same. The
first thing you need to do is connect your sound source, such as an electronic
keyboard, to the input of your sampler. Then you should start up your sampling
program (if you haven't done so already). Many programs have a "monitoring mode"
where you can listen to what you will be recording before you actually record.
If possible, take advantage of this so that you can adjust the sampler's input
level and your sound source's volume before sampling to avoid problems with
volume (see below).

When you have adjusted the volume, or if you do not have a monitoring mode,
you can actually sample the sound. Usually this just involves clicking on a
"Start" button, playing the sound on the sound source, and clicking on "Stop".
Then you will probably be taken to an editor screen where you can see what
you have recorded. You may discover one of two problems with your sample at
this point (especially if you couldn't monitor the signal ahead of time):

- If the overall volume is too low, you lose resolution and clarity in the
sample. Generally, if the maximum amplitude of your sample (on a typical
waveform display, represented by vertical distance from a central axis) is
less than three-quarters of the total window height, your sample is too soft.
For sounds that you want to be soft, you can adjust the volume later inside
the module.

- If the volume is too high, you get "clipping" when the input sound exceeds
the limits of the sampler. If you see flat lines at the top and/or bottom of
your sample display, or if you hear a lot of distortion, your sample is being
clipped; you should reduce the volume or the sampler's input level and sample
again.

Once you have successfully sampled a sound, what you do next depends on what
kind of sound you have sampled. If it is a "one-shot" sound - a sound that
only plays once and does not repeat, such as a drum - you are done, and you
can save the sample to disk, ready to be loaded into your module. However, if
the sample is a continuous or repeating sound, like a flute, you will need to
determine where to place the looping section of the sample.

Determining the loop start and end points is usually a matter of careful
listening and a lot of trial and error. Sometimes you will be able to look at
the sample or a part of it and determine what part of the sample is repeating;
often, however, you will just have to make a guess and play with the begin
and end points until the sample sounds good. One thing to note when adjusting
the loop points: since the sample right before the end point is immediately
followed by the sample at the start point, those two samples should be very
close if not equal in amplitude. Usually, this can be done by looking for
"zero points" - places where the sample's waveform crosses the zero-axis -
but any value will do. If the two samples are very different in amplitude,
the result will be an audible "click" when the sample reaches the end of
the loop.

This is one easy way to tell whether your loop points are well-placed or not:
if you hear a click while the sample is playing back which was not in the
original sound, you need to move your loop points.

[5.1.2] 'Ripping'

Using samples made by other people by saving samples out of their mods is
generally known as ripping. There are a million conversations about the
ethics of this practice, and still no end in sight to the endless debate
about it.

However, as you will find out, there are more than enough sample sites out
there (with decent samples) that ripping shouldn't be necessary. Just about
any tracker enables you to save the samples in a mod. So all you've got to do
is load the song you want a sample from into a compatible tracker and save it.
There are other programs that enable you to rip samples from mods too, one of
them being DMPC, Dual Module Player Companion by Brad Meier of Psychic Software,
a mod player shell for MS-DOS. While most trackers save samples in their own
proprietary format or as raw MOD-compatible samples, DMPC saves to WAV/VOC/RAW.

        jester wrote in 1998: If you don't have a tracker or a ripper, you
        can still obtain the samples in mods by loading the file into a
        sample editor capable of loading raw sample data. You will have to
        set the number of bits and style (signed or unsigned) according to
        the format you're loading (MOD is signed 8 bit, S3M is unsigned 8
        bit, for example). You will be presented with some static, which is
        the header and pattern data, followed by the samples in the mod. Any
        decent sample editor should enable you to cut out the individual
        samples. The next step would be to get the sampling rate right,
        otherwise the samples will sound off key when used. MOD samples
        generally use a sampling rate of 8363Hz for a C in the second octave,
        so try this for starters (or an integer multiple). The more advanced
        formats with variable CxSpds pose more of a problem, you're basically
        left with your ears and perhaps a musical instrument to get them right.
        Note that a lot of MOD samples are not tuned to C. Quite often, an A
        is played instead when a C should be.

See appendix H for a table of note frequencies to help you calculate the
appropriate sampling rate for transposing wrongly tuned instruments.

[5.1.3] Conversion From Other Formats

jester wrote in 1998: Generally, most trackers read at least some form of raw
sample data. If they output to some form of MOD format, they most probably
read 8-bit signed data, while some PC trackers (most notably ST3) prefer
unsigned samples.

The more modern trackers which read 16-bit samples will most probably read
some standard headered sample format, which makes conversion (with SOX, for
example) pretty easy, so I won't elaborate on it.  See your sample editor's
or converter's documentation. To convert a sample from one filetype so that
you can use it in a tracker for which only raw 8-bit data is suitable, you
need:

        - an input file (yeah, why else would you be reading this, but you do
          need it)
	- a sample converter or editor that can write raw 8-bit data.
	- if this program can't read your input file you need another program
          to convert it to an interchangeable format type, such as WAV, IFF/
          S8VX or VOC, which are readable by most converters and editors.

Go about it this way:

If necessary, convert the input file to the interchange format, leaving its
attributes untouched, if possible (which are the number of bits, channels and
sampling rate).

Now check to see if the sample will be suitable for the tracker. The main
things to look for are sample size in converted state and the sampling rate.
A lot of formats still impose limits on the sample size they are willing to
deal with. Let's assume you have a limit of 64 KB, i.e. 65536 bytes. And that
the tracker (or rather the format) uses 8-bit sample data. Assuming further
that you have an input file that is a 16-bit stereo sample, you must divide
that sample's size by four to estimate its size when converted so that it
suits your tracker ('s format). Four because you divide by two when converting
16 to 8 bits, and by two again because your tracker can only use mono samples
(sorry for having forgotten about this before). If the resulting approximate
filesize (which is approximate because you haven't accounted for the file
header in the calculation) is larger than your limit, write down your result
and look at the sampling rate of the input file and the note that it plays at
that sampling rate.

It could well be that your tracker('s) format uses a fixed sampling rate to
reproduce a C in a certain octave and calculates the sampling rates to use
for other notes with reference to this "master C playback sampling rate"
(also known as CxSpd). So, if you have a sample with a different sampling
rate than this CxSpd, the sample will sound off tune. Remember that the C
is THE reference point in the tracker. This is getting too complicated, so
I'll give an example.

Say I want to convert this great Kurzweil 2000 patch for use in a M.K.
tracker, in my case FastTracker 1 (as it imposes even harsher limits than
PT).   I know that FT1 only uses up to 64KB of a sample and that it uses raw
8-bit signed mono data. I also know that M.K.'s root C is the C-2 and that
the playback sampling rate used for that note is 8287Hz for PAL Amiga systems
(and I'm in Europe and NTSC Amigas are far too rare for me to care about).
That's all I need to know about the target.

I know that my source KRZ file is a multi-sample with five 16-bit signed
mono samples in it. I use 2PAT (which has been renamed to AWAVE) or another
program to tell me the KRZ file's information, which gives me the number of
individual samples in the file, their note range, playback sampling rate and
the note this rate represents.  I then use 2PAT to extract the individual
samples to WAV files (actually I already did that and looked up the
information in the description file that was generated simultaneously). I
like the third of the five samples and want to convert this one. The
description reveals that it is 16-bit, mono and plays an A at a sampling
rate of 32kHz. I want to tune my sample to C, so I look up appendix I in
the MOD-FAQ and find that an A is associated to 440Hz and a C to 261.7Hz.
From this I gather that I have to play the sample at ( 32000 * 261.7 / 440
= 19033 )Hz so it sounds like a C. So that's the first thing I do, I change
the sample's playback rate to 19033Hz (NOTE: only changing the SPEED of the
sample, no resampling involved).

In my specific case, the sample I'm converting is not well suited to be
played at more than one octave (this is the case with a lot of real-instrument
samples). So I allow myself to use only the top M.K. octave (from C-3 to B-3)
and resample from 19033Hz to 16574Hz (2 * 8287Hz), which represents a C-3 in
M.K.. I do this while still in the 16 bit domain because of the larger
precision (aliasing faults are less severe and interpolation is more exact).

Then I convert the sample from 16-bit to 8-bit. If the input sample was pretty
quiet, I'd probably maximize its volume first, thereby taking advantage of the
16 bits of resolution and reducing rounding errors.

If my sample is now still larger than 64KB, I have four choices. I can resample
the sample to 8287Hz (no aliasing errors induced, as this is downsampling by
an integer) and halve the sample's size at the cost of losing high frequencies.
I can also resample to a different note somewhere in between the C-2 and C-3,
at the cost of having to transpose the instrument in the M.K. later (i.e.
pitch shifting, as the note shown by the tracker isn't correct). My third
choice is to crop the sample and find a good loop. My final choice is to apply
a volume envelope to the sample and have it fade out fast enough to fit into
the limit. Which method I choose depends on the sound I am converting. Quite
often a combination of several processes will yield the best results.

When I've finished the sample editing process, I either save it in an
interchange format (if the editor doesn't support output in raw signed 8-bit
mono data) which my converter understands, or I write the sample data to disk
in raw signed 8-bit mono style. In the first case, I ask my converter to
perform the just described conversion. Assuming I have written a WAV file and
want to convert it to FT1-usable, I'd use SOX in the following manner: sox -V
infile.WAV -ts8 outfile.SMP  <- issued on the command line I could then load
outfile.SMP into FastTracker 1.

Hope this helps.

[5.2.1] Amiga

MING of DiSC <mattias.inghe@mailbox.swipnet.se> said this in the 1998 update:

        "Amiga, the mother of all mod-hood as we know it today, is still
        going strong as a producer of moddies. And there are plenty of 
        different trackers, players and so forth to choose from. Strange then 
        that I can only find one sample editor. Anyway, the little darling is 
        called Samplitude, and is by many of it's users regarded as being 
        God's gift to mankind. And maybe it is. If mankind was an Amiga". 

        It does a lot of assorted conversion, recording, effect adding,
        amplifying and mixing, and seems to be the best choice for the Amiga
        musician of today.

        http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/pub/aminet/biz/demo/SamplOpus.lha

I wandered around and found this dedicated Samplitude website:

http://www.act-net.com/Samplitude/

And they have this to say:

        There is a mailing list available for Samplitude (Amiga) users that
        is run by the developers actually involved in Samplitude's programming.
        The future enhancements of this software depends heavily on what you,
        the user, need and want - so tell us what the power application should
        look like - to make it an application reason enough to buy an Amiga! 

Take a look at the screen shots.  Gotta admit it does look tasty...

[5.2.2] Atari

Once again, MING of DiSC  <mattias.inghe@mailbox.swipnet.se> tracked down the
following for the 1998 update:

        The LAPD site is dedicated to software for the Atari, but not 
        much is on-line so far. It's worth a try anyway to peek at the 
        music section.

        http://www.lapd.demon.co.uk/music.htm

        I'd still say that was true but be prepared to sift around for
        something good.

        The previously mentioned archive at: 

        ftp://atari.archive.umich.edu/atari/Music/

        is also well worth a visit.   

I wrote the above in 1998, and I've been trying to get through to this site
now for the best part of a week, 404's galore.  I haven't been able to
confirm it but it may mean that this site has now gone bye byes too.  Poor ol'
Atari really seems to be suffering these days

[5.2.3] Mac

This section initally by Matthew E Centurion <mashoe+@cmu.edu>. This section
has been added to by MING of DiSC <mattias.inghe@mailbox.swipnet.se>.

        Matthew writes: Sound Samplers/Editors for the Mac aren't too easy to
        find..but the best Sound Editor for the Mac is "Macromind SoundEdit"
        (Versions include: SoundEdit, SoundEdit Pro, SoundEdit 16" etc..)
        This has to be one of the best sound recorders and editors for mac..
        it has most if not all the options from all the other programs listed
        for other platforms and it can do more stuff.. It has tons of effects
        and other options: reverb, bending, speed, pitch, flanger, noise,
        equalizer, mixer, backwards, tone generator, FM Synthesis, precision
        mapping, spectrum/waveform/dots, up to 44kHz sampling rate 8/16 (and
        even 24 methinks) bit recording, notes/tags on specific sections of
        samples, variety of formats AIFF, System 7 Sound, Resources, WAVS,
        Instrument, au, etc.. etc..)

        I still think that SoundEdit WITH SoundApp is a good combination
        because SoundApp let's you save in more formats than SE can...

        Ming adds: By an extensive websearch I finally came up with some
        hopefully useful hints on proggies to use for sampling on the Apple
        thingamabob. There are actually quite a few, but I'll keep it short,
        and focus on the better ones:

* SoundEffects 

        a commercial wave editing program that can import all of the more
        common formats. I found no list of features, but from the info texts
        I could detect that it did all kinds of echoing, amplifying, flanger,
        equalizing, noise reduction and so on. Latest info (and downloads) can
        be found at:

	http://www.riccisoft.com/soundeffects/

        Another useful site should be this:

	http://macware.erehwon.org/Audio-Midi.html

        It is said to be a great list with a number of sample editors, MOD
        players and Trackers (or rather, Tracker - Player Pro) for the Mac.
        But so far I haven't been able to connect. And last but not least,
        there are editors and converters listed at the Shareware Music Machine
        at www.hitsquad.com.

        http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/Mac2Win/

        Convert Mac Sounds into the Microsoft Windows WAVE Format and back.

	http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/ConvertMachine/

        A batch processing utility to convert sound format files to a desired
        type.

	http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/SoundApp/

        A multi-format sound player/converter. This one is probably the best
        shareware editor out there. Definitely worth a try.

[5.2.4] MS-DOS

Once again, loads of link changes in this section, some programs disappeared
probably forever, and not many new programs to replace them, if any.  DOS is
being ignored by programmers these days, but there are still some decent/
worthwhile programs around that'll do the trick..

* Advanced Digiplayer 3.0 by PSI/Future Crew

        SB & MS-DOS only sample editor, reads mono raw 8-bit and ST3-compatible
        samples and writes ST3 samples: features filters (hi- and low-pass),
        resampling, volume commands (maximize, set, slide and smooth ends), DC
        shift, reverse, reverb, echo, cross fade, robotize, flange, chord making,
        two waveform editing windows, unofficial freeware

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/music/programs/samplers/dp30.zip

is now the correct address for this file.  This site can now ONLY be accessed
by FTP, the www.cdrom.com server is used for web pages ONLY.  Anyway, while I
was there, I found these other sampler proggies, but this is in the soon to
be extinct Hornet archive so it may change at anytime.

[5.2.7] Windows 

This entire section was written by Steve Gilmore <rebriffr@netcomuk.co.uk> 

        "Once again the greatest changes to sample editors is that Windows
        has turned them into digital sound processors of either samples
        in MODs, or even WAV's of the MODs themselves:-)  The greatest
        strides in the technology has been in this area, and most programs
        now come with optional plug-in effects processors working hand in
        hand with Windows DirectX.  There are *tons* of these programs but
        very few that actually deliver the goods.  In the interests of not
        writing volumes, I've restricted it to the very best - in my
        opinion.  There *will* be something here you can use...

        Samples for Windows come in many guises, the main one being WAV.
        Both Fast Tracker and Impulse Tracker import WAV's directly, but
        both progs have trouble with standard stereo samples.  There have
        been several interesting articles on using stereo samples in the
        last issues of Trax Weekly, so more info there.

        The two major programs here are hideously expensive in all respects,
        but take a look at what they can do to your poor, tired samples.
        Most trackers these days use or have access to this high end kit...

I wrote the above paragraphs as part of the 1998 update and things haven't
actually changed that much in the past year.  I'd still recommend Cool Edit/
Sound Forge/Goldwave et al as being major components for any tracker (if
you can beg, steal or borrow a copy that is).  The price of this software
is still completely out of range for most MOD trackers but if you wanna get
serious about your samples there really is no other way to go...  Be prepared
to get a larger hard drive though, when you get to this stuff the WAV's pile
up faster than you can say 'Canute!'.

        Cool Edit Pro is *not* shareware and costs a hefty US$399 but is
        absolutely all you'll ever need. There is, however, a demo of it
        on the site which is for us (much) poorer folk.

        Cool Edit 96 has a shareware version. When you register your copy,
        Syntrillium will issue a registration number that will unlock the
        shareware version so that you can use Cool Edit fully. Syntrillium
        offers two registration levels for Cool Edit. For the $50 Basic
        Registration, you receive a registration number that unlocks your
        copy so that you can use any function at any time. For the $25 Lite
        Registration, you receive a registration number that gives you access
        to all the features of Cool Edit except the following: Compressor, Delay,
        Distortion, Echo, Echo Chamber, Envelope, Flange, Noise Reduction, Quick
        Filter, Reverb, and Generate DTMF Tones. Multi-user and site licenses are
        also available.

Then, there are folks who can't stand Cool anything and swear by:

* GoldWave 

        Yet another program that's changed immensely over the last few years,
        now in it's first beta of Version 4 which available from the web page
        at the end of first quarter of 1998.

http://www.goldwave.com/

	Latest (1999) shareware versions are:

        GoldWave v4.02 for Windows 95/98/NT 
        GoldWave v3.03 for Windows 3.1 
        GoldWave v2.14 for Windows 3.1 for old systems 

        Features: * Multiple Document Interface for editing dozens of files
        in one session * Large file editing (up to 1GB in size) * Configurable
        RAM or hard disk editing * Realtime oscilloscopes (amplitude, spectrum,
        bar, and spectrogram) * Separate, resizable Device Controls window for
        accessing audio devices* Realtime fast forward and rewind playback *
        Cue/Reference points * Direct sample editing with the mouse *
        Intelligent editing (automatically converts mixes and pastes samples
        correctly)

        Effects: * Distortion * Doppler * Echo * Filter * Mechanize * Offset
        * Pan* Volume shaping * Invert * Resample * Transpose

        Supports .WAV, .AU, .IFF, .VOC, .SND, .MAT, .AIFF, and raw data and
        can convert to/from these formats

	You can order Goldwave through the site and it can be registered in
        two different ways:

	Standard (US$30, C$40, UK20)
	Deluxe (US$50, C$69, UK37) 

While I was browsing the site, I also noticed this new product from Goldwave...

* Multiquence 1.0

        This probably doesn't belong in this section but I figure it is soooo
        similar to Cool Edit Pro (which is also a multitrack sequencer as well
        as a primo audio tool.  And, where CEP is well pricey, Multiquence's
        price is extremely tracker friendly..get this:

        Standard (US$50, C$69, UK35) 
        You will receive a password that removes shareware messages and start
        up screens. This password will "unlock" all future versions of
        Multiquence. It is equivalent to getting a lifetime of free upgrades.
        All future versions will be available from the Multiquence home page.

        Registered GoldWave users (US$35, C$49, UK25)
        If you are a registered GoldWave user, you can purchase Multiquence
        at this discount price.

http://www.goldwave.com/multiquence/index.html

* Awave 

	Now at Version 5 and available through FMJ Software at 
	
	http://hem.passagen.se/fmj/fmjsoft.html

I snagged this blurb of the site:

        Audio & wavetable instrument file format converter, editor and player
        that defies logic in the amount of file formats it reads and/or
        writes: (Ed: it does...honest!!)

	Formats supported: Hundreds and hundreds! I tried listing them and
        they took up pages and pages!

	Awave is shareware. There are two ways to register:

        - Online registration service. They accept all major credit cards,
        cheques, bank transfer or cash. The price is USD 52.

        Register directly through FMJ-Software by filling in the 'register.
        txt' form that comes with the program and posting it with the payment.
        The price is USD 48 

I'm sure we've missed some other programs (SAW Plus, Samplitude et al) but in
all my dealings with other trackers, almost everyone uses one or the other of
the above.  All have their good points, more effects, features etc, but only
you can decide whether they are worth the money to you or not.  If money is
tight, both GoldWave and Awave do a sterling job.

[5.3] HTTP/FTP Sites with Samples

Nearly all of the original addresses in this section previously were FTP
addresses, where possible I have also inserted the current website for that
product.  It's always worthwhile taking the time to master FTP though
(I recommend CuteFTP at http://www.cuteftp.com) simply because you may get
quicker download times.  

With the dramatic expansion of the web, a lot of the sites mentioned carry
pretty much all the sample formats.  Finding samples these days is a lot
easier than 1994 which is when the FAQ was first written. A quick web search
on any of the main search engines using either the sample format, or the name
of the instrument/sampler that made the sample will generate loads of links...
And then there's always the ubiquitous Hornet Archive which Snowman assures
me "we have a TON of samples online at http://www.hornet.org/music/samples"
which is still there but may not be soon..

Kurzweil 2000: -	http://www.youngchang.com/kurzweil/
                 	ftp://ftp.youngchang.com

EMAX: -                 http://www.aimnet.com/~qsite/emax/
         		ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/qsite/Emax_2 

These sites are not happening - this is a new site...

http://members.tripod.com/~thekiddx2/index.htm Says E-Max HQ...

http://www.spies.com/Emu/Samplers/Emax/index.html

The above sites are Emax and Emax II User's Group homepage and FTP, because
(according to the blurb) these particular instruments have been discontinued.

SDS (Sample Dump Standard): ftp://alf.uib.no/pub/midi/sds/samples
FTP Site only

Also worth a visit is http://www.soundesigners.com/

EPS-16+: - 		http://www.acs.oakland.edu/oak/eps/eps.html

That URL moved and the whole caboodle is now at the excellent Sound Central
site at:

http://www.soundcentral.com/keyboard/ensoniq/

Sound Central would be an excellent starting place because it features
almost every sample format out there!

TX16W: - 		ftp://ftp-ls7.informatik.uni-dortmund.de/tx16w/samples

This site moved about 5 times since this address and can now be found on the
web at:
 
http://www.t0.or.at/~mpakesch/tx16w/

or by FTP at 

ftp://ftp.t0.or.at/pub/sound/tx16w

Roland Disk Images: - ftp://lotus.waterloo.ca/pub/sgroups/samples

This site moved outta town!  Best thing to suggest here is that you go direct
to Roland's www site at:

http://www.rolandus.com/

Yamaha SY-85 and 99: - ftp://louie.udel.edu/pub/midi/patches/SY99

This site has long gone the way of all things too.  Try the excellent
Yamaha UK site at

http://www.yamaha.co.uk/

(pay particular attention to their soft synths, you trackers! And see the
new Soft Synth section in this FAQ!)

Microsoft WAV: - 

Seems kind of pointless giving you a couple of FTP sites for WAV files.
These are the overwhelming majority of sound samples floating around the
'net.  I did a quick Alta Vista search while writing this and got this
disturbing result: found 67328 AltaVista web pages for wav.  Just think,
up to your armpits in WAV's for eternity!

Of course, not all of these sites supply *instrument* WAVs but some will.  

Personally, I find the best source of WAV instrumental samples are still
from manufacturers and from the really tremendous WAV samples collections
at SoundWave:

http://tilt.largo.fl.us/samples/samples.html

This was the tally of current samples when I was there last (mostly 44.1kHz,
16 bit stereo and/or mono):

SYNTHS 

     Juno 106 samples 
     Waldorf Pulse samples 
     Oberheim Matrix 1000 samples 
     Waldorf Microwave samples 
     Kawai K1 samples 

DRUMS 

     Boss dr550mkII samples 
     Roland MT-32 drum samples! 
     Typhoon TR-808 simulation samples 
     Alesis HR-16 samples 
     Roland TR-606 samples 
     MPEG samples of Linn Drum, TOM, and Univox 

LO-FI 

     Lo-quality samples ("tracker packs")

BIG PACKS 

     	Big combined packs (X5 original, D-50, Juno, DX27S, Pulse, M1000, more) 

        All samples are compressed with Zip for greatest compatability and good space
        savings.

        Roland Juno 106 samples 
        Waldorf Pulse samples 
        Oberheim Matrix 1000 samples 
        Waldorf Microwave samples 
        Kawai K1 (User contribution) 
        Boss dr550mkII pack (Ed: This is a KILLER drum kit!)
        Alesis HR-16 sample pack (User contribution) 
        Roland MT-32 Drums (User contribution)
        Roland TR-606 sample pack (User contribution) 
        Typhoon TR-808 kit (simulation) pack 
        MPEG-3 DRUM SAMPLES (User contribution) 
        Linndrum sounds (105K) 
        Sequential Circuits Tom sounds (20.5K) 
        Univox Micro-Rhythmer 12 sounds (168K) 

TRACKER PACKS 

        1.1-22.2 kHz samples. Format is PCM/RAW, unsigned, 8 bit FYI.
        From X5 described above and the Roland D-50, king of the late 80s.

        SW-PAD1.ZIP - Korg X5 pad sounds and FX (1659K)
        SW-BLP.ZIP - Korg X5 basses, leads, and pads (2216K) 
        SW-DRUMS.ZIP - Korg X5 drum kit (1062K) 
        SW-PIAGT.ZIP - Korg X5 piano, guitar, and organ (2012K) 
        SW-BRWBL.ZIP - Korg X5 brass, woodwinds, and pad final (2240K) 
        SW-CUST.ZIP - Korg X5 custom patches (2356K) 
        SW-D50C0.ZIP - Roland D50 PN-D50-00 card patches (2650K) 
        SW-D50C1.ZIP - Roland D50 PN-D50-01 card patches (3278K) 
        SW-441A.ZIP - Best of packs 1-5, 44.1kHz 8 bit (7435K) 

There's a lot more at Soundwave than the packs I've mentioned, and it's got
lots of links to other sample sites.

Synthesiser samples and more can also be found at Music Machines whose www
address is:

http://www.hyperreal.org/music/machines/

A couple of sites I've personally found useful for WAV *and* other formats
(particularly XI) can be found at

MAz Sound Page: http://www.th-zwickau.de/~maz/

This really *should* be your first stop for almost anything tracker anyway!

* AKA's Home Page: http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~aka/index_e.html

Also the home of the YAMP windows MOD player, the soft synth SMoRPhi 3.0 and
the best collection of XI instruments I've ever come across.  In fact, while
I was there I purloined a couple of the newer samples...

[6] Obtaining Mods
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few years ago, a long list of FTP sites, BBS's and many other esoteric
beasties was like food to a starving man.  At that point it was a ponderous,
disjointed affair, more hit than miss.  Once again, the advent of the www
has galvanised the whole approach of how MODs are distributed.  These days
even the laziest tracker has their own homepage.  The one thing we can't do
in this section is to start detailing individual web sites.  Only sites of
specific significant in terms of downloading or information about downloading
will be included.

There are still PLENTY of FTPs, BBS's and the like, and they all want to
share their archives with you, so let's get at 'em!

[6.1] FTP Servers

Using an FTP program is actually very simple.  Anyone who can recogise a
Directory tree will be able to negotiate almost any FTP site.  There are
numerous programs around for that task, and almost all of them feature
some kind of visual aids.

Logging on to a server, however can get a bit complicated, so here's the
original FAQ FTP advice from Jester <jester@fmr.maschinenbau.tu-darmstadt.de>:

        "The FTP servers mentioned hereafter allow for anonymous FTP.
        Log into the server by specifying 'ftp <server address>', tell
        it 'ftp' when it asks you for a login and supply it with your
        email address as a password.  Alternatively, use 'anonymous' as
        login and your email address as password. Please remember that ftp
        is a privilege, not a right.  Restrict your calls to (the site's)
        non-business hours whenever possible".

A lot of the above information is based on older DOS programs, most recent
FTP software automatically assumes a 'log in as anonymous' posture.  It will
also probably prompt you for your email address in it's setup program, and
use that automatically too.

The largest repository of mods is probably *still* Aminet. Although these
days, the Hornet Archive probably runs them a close second but obviously not
for much longer.  We are talking about *thousands* of MODs here... There are
numerous FTP servers all over the world mirroring it.

An Aminet mirror list follows:

USA (MO)     	ftp.wustl.edu         	pub/aminet/mods
USA (TX)     	ftp.etsu.edu          	pub/aminet/mods
Scandinavia  	ftp.luth.se           	pub/aminet/mods
Switzerland  	ftp.eunet.ch          	pub/aminet/mods
Switzerland  	litamiga.epfl.ch      	pub/aminet/ (*)
Germany      	ftp.uni-paderborn.de  	pub/aminet/mods
Germany      	ftp.uni-erlangen.de   	pub/aminet/mods
Germany      	ftp.uni-bielefeld.de  	pub/aminet/mods
Germany      	ftp.uni-oldenburg.de  	pub/aminet/mods
Germany      	ftp.uni-kl.de         	pub/aminet/mods
Germany      	ftp.uni-stuttgart.de  	pub/aminet/mods
Germany      	ftp.uni-siegen.de     	pub/aminet/mods
Germany      	ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de   	pub/aminet/mods
UK           	ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk      	pub/aminet/mods

I can't be certain that *all* these sites still exist because Aminet itself
often has organisational problems.  I know for sure the UK site is still up
- as are most of the others.  Anyway, the first place to look is the Aminet
main www site at:

http://www.germany.aminet.org

The subdirectories of Aminet they were showing when I last visited was:

/demo         	Gfx and sound demos
/gfx          	Graphics
/mods         	Music modules
/mus          	Musical software
/util         	Utilities

What used to be another HUGE site for mod releases is The Hornet Archive.
However, this is in the slow process of winding itself up.  I fully expect it
to have disappeared by year end, and it has nothing to do with Y2K!.  There
was talk of most of the archive going to www.scene.org but at the time of
writing it still hasn't happened, even though the site is finally back
online!.

Hornet (according to an email from Snowman (Christopher G. Mann) r3cgm@
cdrom.com has/had 5784 songs cataloged and online ready for download
(that's just under 2 gigs in size).  About 75% of which are rated according
to a star system.  The total of MODs online doesn't even count the 440 music
disks online, which add up to 890 megs in size.

http://www.hornet.org/

You should find FTP information and mirror sites right on the front page and
while you are there, grab yourself some of the excellent entries into Hornet's
MSx compos...all top notch tracks

GUS SITES

The GUS FTP sites have probably gone the same way as the soundcards...except
Snowman wrote in March 1998: " The official main Gravis Ultrasound archive
has moved to:"

        ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/gus

And it's still there in 1999, although what may happen to it this year is
anyones guess.

The Gravis main Site 

http://www.gravis.com/
  
had this on it's page in March 1998:

	"November 21st, 1997

        Advanced Gravis regrets to announce that it has discontinued its
        sound card business. All hardware and software product development
        and manufacturing for the sound card business has been halted, and
        Gravis has no additional product available".

And even that had disappeared into the sites nether regions by the time I
came back in 1999.  Of course, it's worth doing a search on the ViperMax,
which is at least a kinda sorta GUS...(I KNOW I'll probably get loads of
flames for this comment, so don't bother....)

Take a look at the PC ToyBox site for more info....

http://www.pctoybox.com/pctoybox/index.htm

Well, my mum didn't raise no sissy faced crybaby, so I went out in search of
any remaining evidence of their existence being the still proud owner of a
GUS Classic...

Main N.American Site:  archive.orst.edu             pub/packages/gravis

This site is still there but not a sniff of GUS...

ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/packages/ultrasound/
 
is now the correct URL and while I was there I found this:

Main Asian Site:        nctuccca.edu.tw                 PC/ultrasound
European Callers ONLY: 	theoris.rz.uni-konstanz.de   	pub/sound/gus

[6.2] BBSs

BBSs have lost a lot of ground in the MOD distribution stakes but there are
still lots around, many of them with extensive MOD archives.  The chances are
that you could probably find the same tracks on the web quicker, and probably
without all the connection hassle.  The BBS scene still lives of course, and
it's prescence on the web is judgement of that.  I did a Yahoo search on just
the terms BBS and got 19 categories and over 2300 sites!

You can also check the comments in the MODs you get, they usually contain
some BBS adverts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[6.3] Newsgroups

Despite some confusion to the contrary (posters do sometimes *by mistake*
post to alt.music.mods), alt.binaries.sounds.mods is THE Usenet newsgroup
for mods.

Binary posts to this group are usually zipped in one file for convenience.
Large, multi-part posts are frowned on in this newsgroup as in many others.
When this MODFAQ was first written, downloading from newsgroups was a
painfully convoluted process of commands.  I would imagine that almost
all of us these days has a browser (MSIE 3.0+, Netscape 3.0+ both have
newsgroup reading facilities) or a dedicated newsreader such as Agent or
News Rover etc.  But, more in the interests of those who still have to
deal with it, here's the original FAQ info:

Jester wrote: 

        How you do it exactly is up to you and the newsreader you're using.
        I will cover NN, RN and TIN here, as well as telling you how to
        cope with dumb uudecoders. Thanks to Stan Greene (Merlin) <
        sorcerer@netcom.com> for supplying the information initially.

NN:     Let's assume you have a list of five articles on screen,identified by
        consecutive letters a through e, of which the last four are the file
        example.mod. First, tag (i.e. mark) the parts by pressing the
        appropriate letters (b through e). Then type the following: ':decode'.
        Choose any directory you wish when prompted for the Decode Directory,
        this is where the decoded file will go. At the next prompt (Decode
        test2/ Article (* +):, for example), enter '*' to specify the previously
        selected articles. NN will then decode the files for you.

RN/TRN: Assuming that the file is in multiple parts, go to the first part and
        press 'e'. Continue going through all of the parts, pressing 'e' for
        each. As you do each part, you should see 'Continuing filename.ext:
        Continued)'. When you get to the last part and press 'e', you're done.
        It knows that the file is complete.

TIN:    We will assume the same setting as in the NN example. The first thing
        you do is move the scrollbar to the first part of the file you want,
        this'd be the 2nd article in the list. Now press 't' to tag the file,
        the plus sign in front of the article should turn into a '1' and the
        scrollbar should move to the next line. Tag all the parts of the file
        in the same manner,watching out so you keep the order correct. When
        you're done, press 's',which gives you the following prompt: 'Save
        a)rticle, t)hread, h)ot, p)attern, T)agged articles, q)uit: T'. The
        default should be a captial T, which is what you want anyway, so just
        hit return. TIN will prompt you for a filename, you can use anything,
        basically, keeping it simple should prove helpful (to you). Done that,
        TIN asks you for post-processing options. Most of the time, you will
        want to uudecode the binaries, so press 'u'. Done.

BY HAND:OK, there are two possibilities here. Either you have a smart uudecoder
        (such as UU, UNPOST or UUMASTER for MS-DOS, or WinCode for Windows),
        or you're stuck with a basic dumb type.

        - SMART: This is pretty simple. Just save your articles to a common
        file and feed it to your smart decoder. Using UU, this'd look like
        this, after having saved some articles to a file called mods.uue:
        'uu /i /s mods.uue'. UU will do the rest. Note that it is good to
        have several smart decoders at hand in case one of them refuses to
        decode a file. You can then always try the others.

        - DUMB: This is tedious. Save the articles, preferrably and for your
        own sanity's sake, to separate files, using some form of numbering
        scheme so you'll know which part is which later on. Then call your
        favourite text editor (as in ASCII) and trim out anything from the
        files that isn't a valid UU line. This includes everything up to,
        but not including, the line saying 'begin 640 blabla.mod', which
        should be in the first part, and everything after the line saying
        'end', which should be in the last part. You also need to trim out
        any checksum info, mail/posting headers and signatures (these should
        be at the end of the files). When you've done all that, concatenate
        (i.e. join) the files, but keep them in the correct order! Feed the
        resulting file to your dumb decoder,

Or.....better yet.....get Free Agent from http://www.forteinc.com :-)

[6.4] WWW (World Wide Web)

The biggest change, and the biggest shake up in the MOD world since this FAQ's
inception is the ever widening spread of the World Wide Web.  It has enabled
the MOD scene to come together in a way those first 'scene'rs could have only
dreamt of.  MODs can be obtained almost everywhere on the web, from the one
man/woman tracker to the multi-member groups such as KFMF, FM and newer
groupings such as DiSC, Explizit etc...

Writing a section about where to obtain MODs on the web is the absolute height
in redundancy.

If you have any doubt about that statement try this:  Open up your browser
(if it's not already open reading this) point yourself at
http://www.yahoo.com (a common web search site)and type in 'MODs' as the
keyword (in that case, but obviously without the ') then search - you should
get over 200 pages!!  Try that in the Alta Vista search engine and you'll
come up with a staggering 13579 entries!!  Of course not all of those entries
are going to be music MODs but it's a fair bet some 75% will be.

So, rather than write about such an overwhelming subject, I decided to
concentrate on what I call 'multi-purpose' MOD sites.  A couple of examples
already mentioned in the preceeding FAQ text automatically spring to mind:
MODplug Central and MAZ Home.  MAZ Home because it features almost everything
you need as either a tracker or a listener.  It really is the ultimate
software stop.  Modplug Central counts as a multi-use site because of it's
extensive dissemination of it's MODplug software, it's tremendous amount of
MOD information (new releases, reviews, MOD facts and news and a large
collection of downloadable MODs).

MULTI PURPOSE SITES

* Hornet Archive: 

        http://www.hornet.org/

        The longest lived multi-purpose site around (since 04 September 1992),
        and now, sadly on its last legs.  Most of the archive will still
        presumably be available through the ftp.cdrom.com connection - and should
        it ever get back online the main MOD tracks will be available at scene.org.
        However, this is still one of the definitive MOD spots on the Web at the
        present time.  Home to a HUGE collection of files and organiser of the
        brilliant MC (Music Contest) series of world wide MOD competitions.  A
        massive MOD resource and a MUST VISIT for any serious MOD fan.

* MAZ Home Page : 

        http://www.th-zwickau.de/~maz/

        As well as being the most reliable source for new sound software, MAZ
        Home has many other attributes.  Trackers and Players in both MOD and
        MP3 format are available for download, there's MAZ's own FAQ, samples
        and softsynths, soundcard software and sound tools by the handful.  It
	really should be the first stop for equipment.

* MODplug Central: 

        http://www.castlex.com/modplug/

        The MODplugin software gave a voice to MODs on the web and this is the
        central site for all MODplug related software.  A Resources section
        features: New Releases, MOD News, MOD Chat, MOD Links and even a
        Computer Music Forum which has some very lively exchanges... It also
        has a subscriber based newsletter full of timely info.  And, new and
        a gratuitous plug :-) is the MODplug Tracker Startup kit....an excellent
        introduction to this popular Windows based tracker.

Trax In Space: 

        http://www.traxinspace.com

        A very extensive site with loads of downloadable tracks; every week,
        visitors are asked to vote for their Favorite Trax of the Week which
        is then compiled in listings. There's an excellent search facility
        where you can search by style or artist, artist profiles are also
        available.  They also do reviews and a subscriber newsletter.

WMR: 	http://www.cyberverse.com/~boris/IMM2/_frames/the-imm.htm
IMM:	http://surf.to/the-imm

        (yep the organisation formerly known as the Weekly Module Review,
        and is now the Internet Music Monitor)

        WMR underwent a major change towards the end of 1998, with Boris
        bowing out of his brainchild.  Since then, it's got a new impetus
        and is now looking finer than ever.  I think there are now several
        hundred (if not thousands) of considered MOD reviews currently
        residing on the site, usually along with a link to the MOD being
        reviewed.   Postings of weekly reviews of three tracks onto absm
        has been in effect since November last year thanks to Chris (of
        Chris and The Clones).  Some of the most respected MOD reviews out
        there, and I don't say that just because I am one of the reviewers :-)
        An excellent site for anyone new to MODs...

United Trackers: 

        http://www.united-trackers.org/

        Now into it's second year but UT is still growing at a phenomenal
        rate.  United Trackers now has 3221 Members, 52 compos, 340 websites,
        688 tracks, tracker databases, briliant discussion boards, columns
        and even a T-Shirt! and much more.  A MOD starting point site for
        any serious newbie to the scene.  The archives are particularly
        useful and the bulletin board is very active...and now...it's
        allied to:

Altered Perception/MODbot

        http://www.modbot.com
        http://www.alteredperception.com/

        A new site (to this FAQ anyway) but one I consider to have a good
        idea, namely SPACE for tracks!  Yep, a site where YOU can upload
        and MAINTAIN your own files!!   You can add your files, change their
        information, remove them, see who's been downloading them, and much
        much more!  A demos section will be up later.  Of special mention
        on this site is the allied modbot.com, an excellent search utility
        - if a little sparse at the moment!  Give it a bit of time though,
        this site should expand handsomely... :-)

MODRing: 

        http://miso.wwa.com/~daf/modring.html

        Started in September 1996 with just 5 sites, the MODring has grown
        into a bandwidth eating monster, easily outstripping all other
        attempted MOD rings.  At the time of writing it had a staggering
        1032 MOD sites on it. Think, you could spend all your time online
        on MOD sites alone!  One of the prime sources for 'blind' or random
        MOD wanderings - a surprise around every link.  Even the quickest
        browse through the ring will show the amazing diversity and range
        MOD music has achieved.

Kosmic Free Music Foundation (KFMF): 

        http://www.kosmic.org/

        The original and still one of the very best MOD sites on the Web.
        Currently with 30 or so members, KFMF still features the very best
        the scene can offer.  Mind you, while I was there, I found this
        message from Maelcom <maelcum@kosmic.org>:

		"Dear fans & listeners: 
                Last week over 10,000 different hosts (IPs) visited
                kosmic.org via the web, and over 22 gigabytes of
                music and documents were sent out. This is all good,
                but the simple fact of the matter is that it's becoming
                increasingly difficult for me to support this
                organisation out of my own pocket. For all those visitors,
                there were maybe three people who ordered CDs! I want to keep
                this site free to the public, but in order to keep it that way
                we need your support financially. Kind email doesn't pay the
                bills, and this site is not free to maintain.

                If you like our music, put your money where your mouth is.
                Buy theHacker's album if you liked his new song, buy B00MER's
                new CD if you just sent him an email about how much you like
                his stuff. Click  on those annoying off-site advertising
                banners once in a while (that's like donating $0.05 each time).
                Spread the word about Kosmic to all your friends.. don't sit
                on a good thing and try to keep it all for yourself!

                And if you are indifferent after hearing all this, don't be
                suprised when you come to visit kosmic.org next time and it's
                no longer around. Think about it. "

        A little extreme, but an admirable sentiment and one most downloaders
        should remember about all these wonderful web sites.  Someone, somewhere
        *is* paying money out of their own pocket to provide you with all this
        great free music. Help to support the scene, and you'll help to keep it
        going and growing...

When I wrote the above addendum in 1998, Hornet was probably just about coming
to the decision to close the archive.  Obviously, the slams the lesson home
even further. However, when I went back to Kosmic for this update, things had
obviously changed a little because Maelcum now had this to say:

        Welcome back to kosmic.org. Thanks to the continuing support of our
        listeners we have been able to re-open the site at colba.net, however
        we're not out of the woods yet. We have raised about half the money
        needed to purchase the new server, and must raise the rest between
        now and the end of January. At that time we will have to relocate
        to our new home at Vision Online, one way or another.

Obviously, keep watching that space!  And, Maelcum, nice new design ya got
there!  Well cool.....

The Scene: 

        http://www.scene.org/

        As a MOD resource in its own right (IRC servers/channels for trackers,
        FTP sites for tracks and software) scene.org also hosts the following
        sites:

     	Five Musicians: http://www.fm.org/
     	m0n0: http://www.scene.org/mono/
     	brothomStates: http://www.brothomStates.scene.org/

MOD TRACKING TUTORIAL SITES

Once upon a time, trying to find out how to track was a forlorn and lonely
task.   It really was a question of RTFM and be done with it.  Of course you
could ask a question about tracking online and risk a bunch of flames, but
that took a brave spirit.  At the time of writing there are many good sites
that offer general/specific tutorials on the use of trackers.

* Introspective's The Zen Of Tracking: 

        http://www.cyberverse.com/~boris/IMM2/_frames/the-imm.htm
        http://surf.to/the-imm

        The daddy of them all, and still one of the webs most visited (and
        informative) tracking resources.  Run by well respected scene
        figures, this should be any MOD newcomers Top Sites list.  They now
        have a mirror link on Hornet as well, so I imagine the site is in for
        some fairly rapid expansion.  Anyway, *tons* of tracking tips and
        information right here; interviews with established trackers and
        technical articles.  A treasure trove of good, reliable information
        on both the scene and the technical aspects of tracking.  Although
        the site was originally started Jeremy Rice (a long time scene
        member), he's now been joined by Smash (of Noise), Screamager and
        Radix - who are three of the better known and active members of
        today's tracking scene.  All in all, expect great things from this
        rejuvenated site.

Obviously, should have kept my big mouth shut because zooooom, down goes both
the Hornet link and even the original (ie Jeremy Rice's) ZoT site.   However,
the material in the archive has been saved and is now part of the re-juvenated
Internet Music Monitor site.  New articles have been added to the archive
since it became part of IMM, and you may even see a familiar face at the
maintainance desk :-)

* Scream Tracker Tutorial: 

        http://www.ovnet.com/~voltz/music.htm

        Pirate Pete runs a good, informative site with a more than adequate
        Scream Tracker tutorial that will certainly get the beginner up and
        tracking in no time.  A no-nonsense, straight down to it look at the
        basics of tracking that is well worth a visit if ST3 is your tracker
        of choice.  This site also hosts several other items of interest, as
        well as MODs from Pirate Pete himself...

* Rubz Tracking Page FT Tutorial: 

        http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~u05rjf/tracking/

        This site seems to have bitten the cyberdust.  Having exchanged a
        couple of emails with Rubz about this, he seems to have had
        problems with his machine and no longer has a copy of it himself.
        If any reader happened to save the site information, both Rubz and
        I would be very interested in hearing from you.

* Protocol Music Archive IT Tutorial: 

        http://www.netmagic.net/~tenchi/prot-eff.htm

        The link above should take you straight to the page about using
        effects in Impulse Tracker, but don't neglect the rest of this
        large site.   There's a lot of very relevant information all
        over this site, including discussions about the differences between
        MIDI and MOD (always a absm favourite!).  It's also home to Acid,
        and MOD group Phluid which includes some very famous scene names
        including Trax Weekly's Psibelius....

* MODdocs: 

        I was beginning to despair that I'd ever track this file down again.
        Thanks to Greg K <greg@kruk.prestel.co.uk> it just came in under the
        wire.  This is an excellent text based, stand alone tutorial for
        Impulse Tracker.  It's still a little short on detail, but it does
        improve with each succeeding version (latest is 3.2).  Well worth
        the 50k download

And that URL went bye bye too...  Sheesh.  If anyone can point me to it's
present whereabouts on the net I'd be obliged.  I have my own copy but I'd
rather feature the actual website :-(  But, if you want a copy emailed to you,
let me know.

* Trackers Handbook

        http://www.united-trackers.org/

        is one of the best sites for this little gem from absm poster and
        tracker, Cools <Matthew Coulson>.  Arguably one of the very best,
        and eminently readable, tracker tutorials around.  Described (often)
        in the media as the 'legendary Trackers Handbook' and that ain't
        far off the mark

There's also an excellent MODplug Tracker Startup Kit available from the
MODplug Central site which includes samples, tutorials etc:

[6.5] CD-ROMs

Like most areas of the MOD scene, distributing MODs by CD-ROM have undergone
a sea change.  With the introduction of affordable read-write CD-ROM
technology,  the whole world and his tracking brother are releasing CD's of
their material.   Certainly the major MOD sites Aminet, cd-rom, Hornet, KFMF
and others are actively marketing and still selling CD's (although Maelcum's
note casts some doubt on how many - see [6.4] WWW).  In the original FAQ,
jester mentioned Aminet and several other sources, and I resolved to check
them out:

Aminet has this on the website about CD sales:

- Aminet-on-disk. You can order single Aminet files (3 DM per disk)
  or per-directory subscriptions (2 DM per disk) from Martin Schulze,
  Parkstr. 14,  66806 Ensdorf, Germany.  Phone: +49 (0) 6831 506171,
  email masc@coli.uni-sb.de . Send 3 DM in stamps or $2 to get an index
  disk with instructions.

  Aminet-on-disk is available on Amiga-Floppy (880k: 3DM, 1.76MB: 5DM),
  SyQuest 88/105/270MB and 128MB-Magneto-Optical. (DM 0.40 per Megabyte
  without media costs)

I'm not sure whether they still do the numbered CD system jester decribes
below but I would imagine so.  Jester wrote this description in the original
FAQ:

        Aminet CD 
        * Contains 330 MB of software 230 MB of mods, 100 MB of top
        downloads consisting of 1700 mods, 1600 utilities, 250 games,
        100 demos and 80 animations.
        * Availability: shipping (whatever that means - jester)
        * Avilable in two versions, Aminet Gold and Aminet Share. The higher
        priced version includes a donation to the otherwise unpaid makers
        of the CD, the lower one doesn't (donations are still accepted).
        * Compatible with all Amigas including CDTV/A570. Not compatible
        with CD32 plus Communicator. Compatible with CD32 plus SX1.
        Compatible with all Amiga OS versions for the access software.
        Compatible with all operating systems, except some MS-DOS CD-ROM
        file systems that can't handle mixed case filenames.

The Aminet website:

http://www.germany.aminet.org/aminet/dirs/aminet/disk/cdrom/

has all of the previous Aminet CD's listed and indexes of what's on the disks
so I'd say the system still holds true.  Go over there for ordering
information.

There is also a comprehensive list of PC scene CDROMs and other information
located at http://www.hornet.org/info/cds

Since all of the other CD's mentioned in the original FAQ featured snailmail
addresses and telephone numbers, I would have imagined they had long stopped
trading.  If you know different and you issue MOD CD-ROM's (ie not a tracker
operation) please get in touch and let me know.

On that subject, take a troll over to the Maz Sound Page

http://www.th-zwickau.de/~maz/

and take a look at some of the excellent CDs on sale there including sample
CD's AND Maz's own (compilation) Tracked Worx CD's.

A word of caution.  There are plenty of people out there hawking 'so-called'
MOD anthologies.  Do be careful when buying stuff like this.  The chances are
that you'll end up with a CD-ROM full of crap tracks and not a lot else.
Suppport the scene by buying your MODs within it.  If you like an artist/group
so much you download their entire catalogue for your listening pleasure, pay
them the respect of buying a CD from them too.  One hand washes the other...

[7] Distributing Mods

When you're sick of listening to other people's creations, have mastered a
tracker and finally come up with something you consider brilliant or at
least good enough for other people to enjoy, you want to spread it.  Or at
least foist it onto a completely unsuspecting John Q Public :-)   Well,
let's show you some foisting tech talk then eh?

[7.0.1] Compression

Thanks to Rich La Bonte <flatrich@aol.com> for suggestions concerning this
section.

It is always a good idea to compress a module before you distribute it.
Especially when using tele-communications systems (i.e. telephone lines or
networks), data compression can reduce a lot of transmission time and
bandwidth. The two main archivers used in compressing mods are LHA/LHarc and
PKZIP. LHA is used mainly on Amigas, but compatible archivers/dearchivers
exist on just about any platform. The same goes for the MS-DOS originated
PKZIP. Other archivers may perform better compression, but aren't a good
choice if you want your file to be decodable by as many people as possible.

Note though that even though LHA/LHarc's archiving is generally compatible
across platforms, users should be aware of the limitations of other systems.

While flipped orders of filename and extension is rather easy to fix and is
not a problem (by which I want to express that I discourage discussions
about efficiencies and deficiencies of the various platforms), there are
several incompatibilities which hinder distribution.

LHA/LHarc for Amiga can store attributes that prevent MS-DOS LHA from
dearchiving the files contained. A filename beginning with a period has
the same effect, as MS-DOS uses the period to symbolize the current directory
only. Mac files include a header containing a resource and a data fork. The
resource fork is absolutely Mac-specific and is incompatible with any other
system (AFAIK).

Netiquette still ensures that most Usenet postings are compressed in some
form.  LHA, ZIP, ARJ, SIT are the predominant varieties but you will find
others around (RAR for example is fairly new).  Most decent MOD sites will
give you options on where to download compression tools from but.....

just in case you want it *NOW*!!

Do a web search using any of the archive extensions and 'compression(ie .zip,
.lha, .rar compression) and you should find the program quickly enough

NOTE: An Iomega 'Zip' drive and a PKZIP file are very different methods of
file compression.  The so called 'ZIP Drive' is a peice of hardware, PKzip
and PKunZip are software from PKware:

[7.1] Usenet Posting (to a.b.s.mods)

jester wrote the following in the original FAQ.  I assume that this
information will still be relevant for some USenet members...

        This being the FAQ for the group, it is natural that postings to it
        should find a place here. Usenet poses some difficulties concerning
        the transmission of binary data, as mods are. Only 7-bit ASCII is
        transmitted, while binaries are 8-bit files. This means that mods
        need to be encoded before they can be posted to Usenet. There are
        several encoding methods, the most common being uuencoding. Others
        include MIME, XX and a few others, but these are not recommended
        (you want as many people as possible to hear your creations, don't
        you?). Don't even attempt to post a binary to usenet without having
        encoded it to ASCII.

        Use of encoding methods other than uuencoding is strongly discouraged.

        Uuencoding is the de-facto Usenet standard and tools exist to deal
        with it on virtually all platforms, while other standards, while
        perhaps being better in some respects, are bound to cause problems
        for a lot of users.  Another problem is that some news servers don't
        read more than a certain amount of lines in usenet postings. This is
        why most posts are split into 'small' chunks. A maximum of 1000 lines
        seems sensible (this is roughly 64 KBytes).

        It is considered good netiquette and STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to supply a
        part zero of howevermany including a description of the posted file.
        I hereby declare the following as the FAQ-standard part zero for
        a.b.s.mods:

        - example cut here - - - - - - - - - - -
        FILE NAME: example.mod
        SONG NAME: The exemplary Song
        ARCHIVE: PkZip 2.04g
        MOD TYPE: 8CHN
        COMPOSER: Nobody
        METHOD: Original
        MUSICAL STYLE: ambient deep techno house
        POSTER: Nobody too <nobody@nothing.not>
        UPLOADED TO: ftp.cdrom.com/pub/demos/music/incoming/example.zip
        COMMENTS: This is just an example
        - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -cut here-

        Explanation of the above:

        - FILE NAME: This is pretty clear. I suggest the original mod's
        extension be stated, as the archiver is stated further down.

        - SONG NAME: The name given to the song in the mod's songname field.
        Or the full name of the song if that field didn't suffice (example:
        "I'm gonna be infectious" by Romeo Knight)

        - ARCHIVE: The name of the archiver used. Only LHA/Lharc and PkZip
        and compatible programs are encouraged. It is important to specify
        the version number here.

        - MOD TYPE: The exact mod type. MOD is not exact! See section 2 for
        a list of exact mod type definitions.

        - COMPOSER: The person who made the mod, if known.

        - METHOD: The method with which the mod was made. There are four
        categories here, Original, Conversion, Transcribed and Sampled.

                + An Original is any original composition, music that
                originated in a mod type. Pieces originated in one mod
                type and then transferred to another also qualify for
                this term.

  		+ A Conversion is a composition that has been converted
                from another type of music format (e.g. MIDI, ROL, CMF)
                to a mod type format. Slight re-edits of the mod file are
                still to be considered Conversions.

                + A Transcribed mod is a transcription of music that
                originated in a non-computer form, such as sheet music
                or as music on CDs and/or cassettes.

  		+ Sampled mods are pieces of music strung together in a mod
                format by sampling parts of a song (usually from CD or
                cassette) and playing them at a constant speed.

        - MUSICAL STYLE: A rough approximation of the style the song is in.
        No attempt should be made to try to fill this entry out exactly, as
        it just isn't absolutely possible. However, an estimation of the
        style should be supplied, as this is possible in most cases.

        - POSTER: This is you. Your name and/or handle and/or email address
        should go here.

        - UPLOADED TO: Where else the mod is available, per ftp for example.

        - COMMENTS: Write anything you feel should be said about your posting
        and/or its contents here.

        Use subject lines that include the filename of your posting and the
        part number, the latter either in brackets (recommended) or in the
        form "part x of y".  If you feel like it, put a very short
        description in the subject line.  However, if you follow this guideline,
        a subject line saying simply "EXAMPLE.abc (x/y)" should suffice.

        The above example would have the following subjects, assuming that the
        uuencoded data took four parts:
                Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (0/4)
                Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (1/4)
                Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (2/4)
                Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (3/4)
                Subject: EXAMPLE.MOD (4/4)

Although a lot of ISPs still have the kinds of limits jester describes, most
posts onto absm are more often in one large zipfile, and have been for a
couple of years now.  Usually, it's a two part message ie 00/01 where 01 is
the zipfile and 00 is the comments page jester mentions.  I tend to agree
with the general efficiency of this method because there was nothing more
frustrating than trying to tie a MOD together that came in 12 parts!!

The last time I saw a multi-part posting was about a year and a half ago, and
the poster got roundly flamed for doing so!  However, if that is your only
method of uploading, I'm sure if you explain it in a text introduction, most
newsgroup regulars would cut you some slack.  However, most ISPs do have
larger Usenet feeds these days so it's not unusual to see a 1.7MB MOD in
one part, in fact its become a de facto standard almost everywhere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7.2] FTP Uploads

Most of the ftp servers you can download mods from will accept uploads too.

These usually go in an /incoming directory somewhere. Be sure to upload a
text file with a short description (similar to part zero in section 7.1)
along with the mod. Also remember to specify 'bin' for binary transfer,
or your mod might be transmitted as a 7-bit file, thereby completely
corrupting it. Making an announcement in a.b.s.mods about your upload
will most probably be welcome.

See the section [6.1] FTP for lists of FTP servers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[7.3] BBS Uploads

Sounds terribly dumb I know, but if you managed to download something from a
BBS, you probably know how to upload something too. The process is very
similar to uploading and downloading on the Internet.  Once again, the BBS
scene is thriving and is always a good source of MOD related bits and bobs.
Scour the computer mags you read for new sites near you...  They can often
be a cheap way of gaining almost full Internet access for a fraction of the
regular ISP charge...

==============================================================================

[8] Other MOD services

Since it's inception the absm FAQ has served as a reference for all things MOD,
but this now really has to be stretched a little to cover the new ways the web
has given us to communicate with each other.  Lots of MOD sites now carry
their own Java chat rooms, IRC is awash with #trax clones, many sites have
newsgroup type thread conversations (usually called forums or bulletin boards)
and almost everyone I know uses ICQ.  This section, then, will cover all these
developments.  If you feel something you do fits into this category, please
email me with information and I'll come over and take a look at it.

==============================================================================

[8.1] MOD Chat

Listing every web site that has a MOD chat room would be almost as impossible
as listing every MOD web site.  Instead, Let's just take a look at the two
*main* areas that people meet to talk face to face.  The primary source has
always been IRC in general and #trax in particular.  This method (although
still boasting millions of users) has been joined in the last couple of years
by Java chat rooms and the ICQ network.

A word of caution: If netiquette is important when posting onto a newsgroup,
it becomes crucial when chatting online.  Most new users tend to go a little
crazy when they first discover net chatting, and just blurt out whatever comes
into their heads.  Chatting is most definitely a medium where a little thought
about what you are saying goes a long, long way.  In the various places I am
about to describe you are going to meet some famous folks on the scene.
Remember above all, that these people are also some of the busiest people
around, and consequently it's best that you don't waste their time in idle
chatter.  Most of us just don't have the time for it.  Although most trackers
I know will join in conversations of interest, they really don't have the time
to just pass the time of day.

Remember also that the have heard all the normal tracking conversations a
million times, and they are probably not interested in what you consider the
merits of this tracker or that.  I would advise you to watch the conversation
and - when you feel you have something to say - say it as best you can.  If
you make some valid or interesting points, people will start to approach you
with 'private' chats (ie off channel, one on one) and this is where the real
action takes place.  Mostly, wait to be approached unless you have a specific
question for someone else on that channel, then ask them if they will respond
to a question.  Mostly they will ask you what you need.

* IRC 

        #trax is still the number 1 IRC channel for serious trackers and
        you will definitely be seeing some very famous names in there.
        It's moved around a lot over the past few years, but it's now at
        scenenet.  There are several servers to choose from, including
        irc.kosmic.org, irc.groove.org, irc.spin.org, and irc.demoscene.
        net - all will lead you eventually to #trax. If all else fails log
        into any ircnet site and join #trax.  

There are a few other #trax dotted around the IRC universe, none of them are
the original (and best) #trax unless it is on one of the above servers.

On DALnet there's also a couple of channels worth checking out #ssoft and
#square - compo's and MOD trackers where I've had some very interesting
tracking conversations.  Dialling into any DALnet server should get you these
two channels, and a few others that come up.  Try #mod_musicians for example,
or #traxinspace etc...

I'm *certain* there are more channels than the ones mentioned, so if you know
of anymore, email me and let me know.

If none of the above makes any sense to you, point your browser at:

http://www.mirc.co.uk

and learn all about the essential peice of IRC kit, mIRC.

* ICQ (I Seek You?  Gedditt?....Doh!)

	Almost a direct descendant of IRC, ICQ takes the whole 'hi there!'
        routine	onto another plain. Looking and acting suspiciously like
        AOL's 'Buddy List' feature,installing ICQ will instantly put you
        in touch with your net neighbours.  When you are online, you can
        see who else is on line with you - all 20+ million of 'em (at the
        present ICQ count) if ya want!.  Then you can pester them with
        annoying questions, invite them into mindless chat for hours or
        even send them files of your latest opus!  Sounds like fun,eh?
        Most of the people I know on the scene now have ICQ, and certainly
        the most active members of the absm newsgroup all use it.   You can
        get it at:

        http://www.icq.com/

* JAVA Chat

	I know there are many sites that have MOD related chat rooms but
        there very rarely appears to be anyone in them.  That may be due to
        my own weird work schedule, or because no-one actually *uses* this
        facility.  If anyone knows any different, I'd be more than happy to
        feature it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[8.2] NEWS/Ezines

        Most MOD people know about Trax Weekly, and maybe Signals, but if you
        look around there are plenty of e-zines, newsletters and the like on
        the subject.

That's what I wrote in 1998, but time rolls on and TW hasn't appeared in all
that time.  Once again, I blame it one the curse of MODFAQ :-)   It has been
sort of replaced by another excellent e-zine from Coplan called Static Line.

* Static Line

I nicked this snippet...

        Subscribing to the Static Line mailing list is simple.  Using your
        preferred e-mail account,send an e-mail message to majordomo@kosmic.
        org.  In the the message text, include the following command:
        "subscribe static_line".  If you complete this part correctly, you
        will receive a message with instructions on how to confirm your
        application to the mailing list. Follow the instructions carefully,
        and you're set.  Good luck, we'll see you soon.

        http://www.ic.i7.net/statline

        It's a good MOD read though, so grab it while TW wanders the
        wilderness..

* Trax Weekly

        This has been a staple on the scene since 1995, and is still required
        reading for anyone with a serious interest in what's happening.
        Psibelius, however decided he'd had enough and at this moment the
        'zine is no longer available.  All the back copies are still
        available though, and I can't recommend them highly enough.
        TraxWeekly is available via WWW from: www.hornet.org, under
        section "Information" and subsection "TraxWeekly."

Our old friend The Hornet Archive also keeps TW as well as loads of other
scene related e-zines at:

        http://www.hornet.org/info

But I'd either expect these to end up on scene.org or on ftp.cdrom.com.

Once again, there will be many more ezines out there, any and all information
on this subject is most appreciated.

==============================================================================

[9] Soft Synths/Tracking addons

A new section for this FAQ features software that is featuring more and more
in the tracking scene, soft synths and their associated fans.   Softsynth
is a name coined for software that generates it's own musical tones, but
is applied to all kinds of software.  Softsynth for example can cover tracker
like software like Buzz or AXS or it can be soundcard software such as
Yamaha's Sondius.   I wouldn't, for example call D-Lusion Drumstation a
softsynth, I'd call it a drum machine or a drum sequencer.  See what I mean?
We'll try and make things a *little* clearer as we go along.....hopefully....

Special thanks to wOOd of Acid Demons lars@acid.demon.nl for the chapters
devoted to his favourite toy...Rebirth....who says it far better than I
could ever do... :-)  Why a special place just for Rebirth?  Well, it holds
a special place in introducing us all into the new world :-)  Respect due,
I say...

==============================================================================

[9.1]  Softsynths in General

Since the advent of modern, fast computers, more and more softsynths have
emerged. Some, like Rebirth, try to emulate a certain hardware synthesizer
- others are just a digitized version of a generic analog synth: oscillators,
LFO's and other parts you'd expect in a pre-FM and pre-sampling era musical
instrument. The funny thing is that most softsynths recreate the same
elements, and still don't sound alike. Somehow, the approach that programmers
take makes for a totally unique and independent sound.

So, this is what softsynths do: they try to capture the elements of a real,
physical synthesizer in software. Rebirth was made to mimic the TB-303. Most
others don't set out to sound like a particular synth, but can be made to
sound very TB-like. Another cool thing about softsynths is that programmers
can put in cool stuff like distortion, delay effects and so on.. without
increasing the cost of the program. In hardware terms, every addition would
mean an increase in manufacturing cost. This is the big advantage softsynths
have over hardware - price.

The downside (and I'm talking my personal experience here) is that softsynth
do have the same peakvalue. What I mean by that is, that compared to 'real'
oscillators every softsynth levels out at approximately the same area - really
high dog whistle sounds can't be had with ANY softsynth. But don't worry, you
don't get them from $$$ analog modelling synths either. Er, analog modelling -
wazzad? Well, it's basically the same as a softsynth, except the synth has
been put into it's own proprietory box (e.g. a keyboard with knobs). The softsynth
inside such a keyboard does basically the same, emulating analog oscillators
and LFO's. But because hardware's involved, such instruments tend to be very
expensive. So we'll just forget about those.

Softsynths are an inexpensive way to make music or to create useable
instruments. Some very cool softsynths are actually FREE! We'll be looking
at some and provide you with URL's to try 'm out for yourself.
Read on! 

[9.2] Tracker Softsynths

* Buzz 1.04 (2662 KBytes) by Oskari Tammelin

        There's been an ongoing debate on absm since Buzz first made it's
        appearance about whether this was the new face of tracking, and it
        certainly has the hallmarks of such a thing.  A strange hybrid of
        external software (called machines) is the basis for real innovation
        for Buzz and where most attention has been centered.  It isn't an
        easy interface IMO but there are plenty of people out there who'd
        shout that opinion down, and rightly so.  If you get into it, as
        many have, some of the things you can do with it are pretty
        amazing... The range of machines is growing by the day too...

        http://sorry.vse.cz/maz/synths.html
        http://www.buzz.scene.org/

* AXS 2.02  by NewStyle

        Maz synth page says: it's a software based multi-channel multi-voice
        multi-timbral Physical Modelling Synthesizer.......??!?  It supports
        SB16/AWE or GUS Classic and saves audio to WAV file ,full MIDI
        implementation, external MIDI IN support GUS, SB and COM-port, you
        have access to 4 different channels/instruments via MIDI, VESA 2.0
        with linear frame buffer (LFB) support for the 640x480x256 videomode

        http://sorry.vse.cz/maz/synths.html
	
Definitely worth taking a look at both programs because, sooner or later, all
trackers will look like this :-)

[9.3] Rebirth RB-338

When it comes to software synthesizers, one of the most renowned programs is
Rebirth RB-338. Designed by Swedish Propellerhead software, Rebirth is
specifically geared towards emulating an out-of-production bass-synthesizer:
the Roland Transistor Bassline 303, or TB-303.

        A small history lesson on the TB-303: Launched in 1981, the original
        TB-303 soon turned out a failure - in that it did not sound like a
        real bassplayer, for which it was intended. Secondly it was rather
        difficult to program. The built-in step-sequencer was very restrictive
        and rigid. In a maximum of 16 'steps' (or less) you could play notes
        over a two octave range and assign each note a maximum of three
        functions: down or up, (no) accent or (no) slide. A step could also
        be assigned a rest. 

        It was promply forgotten until in 1987 DJ Pierre dusted it off, and
        used the TB-303 in a track, the mother of acid music: Acid Trax
        (Herbert J / N Jones / Spanky - Published by Sanlar Publishing /
        Leosong). Since only about 20,000 were built during the production
        run of the TB-303 (and a number of machines is thought to have been
        lost through time, wear and tear and accidents), the number of TB-303's
        out there is relatively low. This has pushed prices of the instrument
        to a ridiculous height - and out of the reach of you and me, basically.

        Enter Propellerhead software (PHS). Next to a staggering amount of
        hardware TB-303 clones by numerous companies, PHS created the worlds-
        first software TB-303 emulator. If you don't have it, you can get a
        free demo from the PHS website:

        http://www.propellerheads.se

        Pricing details tend to change with versions, to check on the site
        for accurate information. Version 2.0.1 is the latest version (March
        1999). The new version includes some soundtweaking on the TB-303
        sound and a very good rendition of the TR-909 drum machine.

[9.4] Softsynth/sequencers/others

The place is absolutely awash with the things :-)  Almost as soon as I
started researching some of the links I'd gathered I built up the following
list:

			Acid (the Steinberg version)
			Audio Architect 
                        FruityLoops Pro 
                        Fruity Tracks
                        NovaStation 
                        PhyMod 
                        Generator
                        Reality 
                        Stomper 
                        Mellosoftron 
                        VAZ 
                        Orangator 

And that's just a small list I could dig out, being as ruthless as possible
over what is/is not a softsynth.  Tons, eh?  Here's what's on the excellent
MAZ Sound Softsynth Mirror at:

Appendix B: Common Properties of Module File Formats

They're all chunks of bytes. Heh heh. ;) OK, seriously now.

All mod files contain a header identifying the file and its format. It also
mentions song name and number of patterns in the song. The header is usually
followed by the pattern and sequencing information. Finally, the file also
contains the sample data. This usually takes up most of the space in a mod.
With today's file formats advancing more and more, those are just about all
the common properties worth mentioning, IMHO. For further information on
particular mod types, refer to the format description. This is usually found
in the same archive as the tracker it is connected to. You can also check
some of the audio information sites we covered in the Samples sections..

==============================================================================

Appendix C: Table of Note Frequencies

Use this to calculate sampling rates for mistuned instruments. For example,
if you have an instrument at 8363Hz that plays an A-2 but you want it to play
a C-2, the appropriate sampling rate is 8363 * 261.7 / 440 Hz = 4974 Hz
All values are given in Hz.

(supplied by Chris Craig, author of GoldWave)

C  - 261.7    E  - 329.6    G# - 415.3
C# - 277.2    F  - 349.2    A  - 440.0
D  - 293.7    F# - 370.0    A# - 466.2
D# - 311.1    G  - 392.0    B  - 493.9

Bear in mind that doubling the sampling rate raises a sound by one octave,
halving the rate lowers the note by one octave.

==============================================================================

Appendix D: Overview of Effects Used in Digital Music Modules

This section supplied by Jens Puchert.

The following covers all ProTracker and ScreamTracker 3 effects.  The effect
commands are given for ProTracker first, and then for Scream Tracker.  Fast-,
Take-, and MultiTracker also use the ProTracker command set.  The parameters
are given as "x", "xx", or "xy".  "x" means there's a single parameter for
this effect.  "xx" means there's a single parameter composed of two digits.
"xy" means there are two independent parameters for this effect.

Appendix E: Using Archie

Written by Tobias Reckhard (jester) on 2 Mar 98 for the FAQ for alt.binaries.

1. What is Archie?
2. How can I use Archie?
2.1 Archie clients

2.3 Telnet Archie access
2.4 Archie by Email
3. Table/List of Archie servers worldwide
4. Resources/References

1. What is Archie?

Archie is a service to help find files on FTP servers in the Internet. Archie
servers maintain databases about FTP servers around the world, which they
continually scan to update their databases. Because the resources necessary
to maintain an Archie server for the Internet are immense, there are only
realitively few of them in the World (see section 3 for a list). The quality,
i.e. reliability and up-to-date-ness of the information of the different Archie
servers vary, depending somewhat on their geographic location. An Archie
server typically knows a lot about the FTP servers close to it, less about
far away sites. This means the Archie server closest to you may not find the
particular file you're looking for because it doesn't exist on an FTP server
in your country or neighbouring countries. Should this be the case then move
on to the next server close to you. You probably shouldn't begin with very
remote servers because their responses will be rather slow and they will
answer your request largely with remote sites, which means slower downloads
than from near sites too.

It is important to note that Archie servers monitor only FTP sites, not the
Web. However, should you be using the Web, you're probably familiar with the
numerous Web search engines.

2. How can I use Archie?

There are four ways to access Archie, direct access using an Archie client,
access via World Wide Web pages, access by a Telnet interface and access by
email.

2.1 Archie clients

Archie clients use the Archie protocol (defined in RFC xxxx) to communicate
with Archie servers in their native language. See section 4 below for links
to pages with Archie clients. Unix users with X-Windows have the xarchie
program at their disposal.

The modes of operation of the clients are program-specific, preventing a
detailed description. In general, you will be able to specify an Archie
server to use and input a search string that the server is to be queried for.
You will probably also be able to select how your input string will be matched
with database entries. There are seven possibilities concerning this 'search
type', judging from xarchie, at least, them being exact, substring, subcase,
regular expression (regexp), as well as 'exact' variants of the latter three.
Exact mode is the fastest search method of all. The restriction is that the
user string has to match the string in the database exactly, including case.

This is for those people who know exactly what they are looking for. An
example might be "fm-systm.zip".

Substring (case insensitive) mode means a simple, everyday substring search.
A match occurs if the the file (or directory) name in the database contains
the user-given substring. For example, "is" will match "islington" and "this"
and "poison".

Subcase is the case sensitive companion to substring mode. "TeX" will match
"LaTeX", but not "Latex" or "TExTroff".

Regular expression mode gives you the power to use regular expressions in
your search strings. They are a topic of their own, however, and I have not
mastered their art fully yet (fully? Hah! I know a *bit* about them). They
resemble the common concept of wildcards used to specify parts of filenames,
but are more complex and thus powerful.

The exact variants indicate a stepping approach to the search process. In a
first pass, exact mode is used. If no matches are found, the second mode
specified is used. For example, in exact substring mode, should the exact
search fail, a second search pass will be performed, using substring mode.

2.2 Web Archie access

Many sites now offer Web interfaces to Archie servers. See the list in
section 3 or one of the Archie server lists mentioned in section 4 for
specific URLs. There are two types of Web interfaces, the ones with forms
and the ones with-out them. The form interfaces are fairly intuitive and
straightforward to use, you are supplied with entries for the search string,
the type of search (see 2.1 on this) and the Archie server to be used, to
name the most important points. The formless interfaces look rather bland,
from what I can tell you are only prompted for a search string and that's
it.

2.3 Telnet Archie access

You can use the Telnet protocol to access Archie servers too. Telnet is an
Internet protocol (i.e. based on TCP/IP) to login to remote hosts across the
net. Unices have always offered Telnet clients, Windows 95 has one too. The
operation is pretty simple, you supply your Telnet client the host you wish
to telnet to and login on that host. If you're connecting to an Archie server,
it will tell you in an opening screen which name to use to login. Since the
individual servers differ in their commands, I will not even attempt an
explanation here. You're probably best off issuing the command 'help' or '?',
which should give you a list of available commands with the option of
specifying one of them to aquire help on it. Or it will at least tell you
what to do in order to receive an explanation of the usage of the interface.

A last remark: the resources in section 3 give addresses in the form of
'somebody@somewhere.on.the.net'. These are email addresses, not Telnet!
Use only the host part of the address, i.e. everything trailing the '@'
in your Telnet connection.

2.4 Archie by Email

This is handy for people who either don't have Web access or want their
information in a storable fashion (not like a Telnet session). Email
Archie clients work much like listservers for mailing lists. They parse
commands sent to them by email, either in the subject line or the body
of the message (or both), and respond by sending out emails themselves.
As with Telnet, the actual commands depend on the server software and
vary, so I won't go into an explanation. Again, it's best to send an
email to the site you're interested in, specifying only the word 'help'
in the subject line and on the first line in the body of the message. Be
sure to send pure ASCII, I doubt any of the servers understand HTML email.
You should receive an email describing how to use the server rather soon.
From my experience, Archie and FTP by email are very reliable (of course, for
FTP your mail account has to be large enough).

Appendix F: Calculating Note Frequencies

        > If you can, please help me out. Just think about all the good

I'd worked it out four years ago and written a program to give me every
audible note's frequency, but the computer that's on is at home -- so let's
work it out here, shall we?

OK, you've already said yourself that doubling the frequency raises the note
by an octave. This means that if we plot the frequency over the notes and
octaves, we're going to get something looking like a square function, i.e.
something like f(x) = a x^2 + b. If we use a logarithmic base 2 scale on the
Y-axis (that's f(x)), the graph will look linear.

Now let's see.. A is our reference point, at 440Hz, the next one being at
880Hz. log2(440) = log(440) / log(2) = 8.78 ;  log2(880) = 9.78 Hah!
Cool, exactly one apart (btw, if you want the rest of the decimal places,
they're: x.781359713).

Hope you haven't given up, I'll agree that I've been mumbling a bit of stuff
w/o making it clear where I'm going. So here it is: Frequencies and notes
have a logarithmic (base two) relationship to another. As you can see above,
the base 2 logarithm of 880 is exactly that of 440 plus one. 1760 is up by
another one, try it. Now, there are twelve notes in an octave, let's count
them:

1  2  3  4  5 6 7  8 9 10 11 12
C  C# D  D# E F F# G G# A A#  B

OK, those are half-notes, but they are the ones that are equally spaced
frequency-wise (logarithmically, of course).

We can divide the range between two A's linearly into twelve equal segments.
They are one apart, so each half-note is one twelfth away from the ones next
to it. Then we take two to the power of the number we have and we get our
note frequency.

Allow me to demonstrate. We're looking for the frequency of the C under the A
at 440Hz (that's our reference point). It's nine half-notes further down,
so we subtract nine twelfths (three quarters) from 8.781359713, leaving us
with 8.031359713. Take two to the power of that, gives us: 261.6255652Hz,
which is, btw, correct (one of the frequencies I know by heart from fiddling
around with ST3 C4Spds two years ago a lot).
