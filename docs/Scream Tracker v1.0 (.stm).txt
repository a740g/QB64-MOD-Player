with YOUR help that the list can continue to grow.  Please send
all changes to me rather than distributing a modified version of the list.

This file has been authored in the style of the INTERxxy.* file list
by Ralf Brown, and uses almost the same format.

Please read the file FILEFMTS.1ST before asking me any questions. You may find
that they have already been addressed.

formats. If an information it is marked "guesswork" or undocumented, you

Information marked with "???" is known to be incomplete or guesswork.

Some file formats were not released by their creators, others are regarded
