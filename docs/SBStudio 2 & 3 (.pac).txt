Overview
SBStudio has its own song file format called PAC or package. A PAC file contains all of the
sheets/patterns and sounds belonging to a song. A sound can also be saved separately as a SOU
file. The PAC format was introduced with SBStudio 2, which saved PAC version 1.4 files.
SBStudio 3 saves version 1.6 files. This document will describe these two versions.

Data Format
PAC and SOU files are made up of data blocks, similar to chunks found in standard RIFF files,
each starting with a block ID and data size. The ID is a four byte string and the data size is
a four byte number, also known as a long integer. This makes the file format easy to support
and upgrade and loaders can easily skip data they don't recognize.

PAC Block Format
Offset  Size    Description
0x00    4       Chunk ID
0x04    4       Chunk Data Size
0x08            Chunk Data Bytes

One tricky thing about working with blocks in some PAC files is that a couple of block types
("SONG" and "SND ") may have a data size of 0, even though they "contain" sub-chunks of data.
It may be inconsistent between PAC and SOU files as well as the different format versions but
it isn't a huge problem because a file loader will simply go on and skip following sub-chunks
if they are unrecognized. These 0 data sized blocks can be simply thought of as markers,
signaling the start of a new set of information. More details about these blocks are discussed
below in their corresponding sections below.

Since the PAC and SOU file formats are native to MS-DOS and therefor Intel processors, all data
values are stored in Little-Endian (least significant byte first) order.

The rest of this document goes through the different types of blocks, describing the format of
their data bytes and what they mean. You can use the table of contents at the beginning of this
document to help find the block type you are interested in.

Package ID Block - "PACG"
This block can be used to verify that a file is actually a PAC file. It is always located at
the beginning of a PAC file and has a data size of the entire file minus it's 8 bytes of block
ID and data size information.

Package ID Block Format
Offset  Size    Description     Value
0x00    4       Block ID        "PACG"
0x04    4       Block Data Size file size - 8
0x08            PAC file contents

Package Information Block - "PAIN"
This block is usually the first block inside of the Package ID Block. It is used to specify the
format and program version numbers as well as the number of sounds in the package file.

Package Information Block Format
Offset  Size    Description             Value
0x00    4       Block ID                "PAIN"
0x04    4       Block Data Size         depends on format version
0x08    2       Format Version          0 - 0xFFFF
0x0A    2       SBStudio Version        0 - 0xFFFF
0x0C    2       Number of Sounds        0 - 0xFFFF

Format Version
The format version specifies the file format version number using two bytes. The first byte
defines the major version number and the second byte specifies the minor version number.

SBStudio Version
The SBStudio version specifies the program version number that was used to create the file.
Like the Format Version, the first byte defines the major version number and the second byte
specifies the minor version number.

Number of Sounds
The number of sounds specifies the number of audio samples included in this file. The actual
sounds are specified in "SOU " blocks.

Package Origin Block - "PAOR"
This block contains information about the program used to create the package and usually comes
after the Package Information block. It was introduced in with Format Version 1.6.

Package Origin Block Format
Offset  Size    Description             Value
0x00    4       Block ID                "PAOR"
0x04    4       Block Data Size         depends on format version
0x08    ?       Program Information     program specific

Song Block - "SONG"
This block marks the start of a song structure which is where the sheets and song settings are
stored. SBStudio 2 had the option to save song files with only this structure, but newer
versions no longer allow this. This block usually follows the Package Information Block.

Song Block Format
Offset  Size    Description     Value
0x00    4       Block ID        "SONG"
0x04    4       Block Data Size See Below

Block Data Size
The block data size is the file size - 8 if it's at the beginning of a song file and 0 if it's
inside a package.

Song Name Block - "SONA"
This block is used to specify the song name as an ASCII string. SBStudio supports up to 40
bytes, but the file format specification does not place this limit on the length.

Song Name Block Format
Offset  Size    Description     Value
0x00    4       Block ID        "SONA"
0x04    4       Block Data Size String Length
0x08            ASCII String

Song Order List Block - "SOOR"
This block is used to define the order which the sheets will be played. Two bytes per are used
for each entry in the order list.

Song Order List Block Format
Offset  Size    Description     Value
0x00    4       Block ID        "SOOR"
0x04    4       Block Data Size Entries * 2
0x08            Array of Entries

Song Information Block - "SOIN"
This block is used to specify various information about a song. It's size is format version
specific, but all versions share the same previous version information.

Song Information Block Format
Offset  Size    Description                     Value
0x00    4       Block ID                        "SOIN"

0x10    x       Audio Channel Pan Positions     0 - 15 each

Sheet Format
The sheet format specifies how the following sheet data is stored. If the top bit of this byte
is 0, the sheet data is unpacked. If the top bit is 1, the sheet data is packed (see sheet data
block for details).

Audio Channel Pan Positions
These bytes specify the pan position for each Audio Channel. One byte is used for each channel
and the value may range from 0 - 15 (0 = left, 8 = center, 15 = right). These pan positions are
only found in format version 1.4. Later version use the Song Channel Settings Block for
defining Pan values.

Song Channel Settings Block - "SOCS"
This block is used to specify the various pan positions and effects levels for each channel. It
is always found in a song block and was added is format version 1.6.

Song Channel Settings Block Format
Offset  Size    Description     Value
0x00    4       Block ID        "SOCS"
0x04    4       Block Data Size 6
0x08    1       Channel Number  1 - 20
0x09    1       Pan Position    0 - 255
0x0A    1       Reverb Level    0 - 255
0x0B    1       Chorus Level    0 - 255
0x0C    1       Filter Level    0 - 255
0x0D    1       Resonance Level 0 - 255

Channel Number
The channel number byte specifies which channel the following pan position and effects levels
correspond to.

Pan Position
The pan position value 0 = left, 128 = center, 255 = right.

Effect Levels
The effect level 0 = off/minimum, 255 = maximum.

Song Channel Name Block - "SOCN"
This block is used to specify the name of a channel. It is always found in a song block and was
added in format version 1.6.

Song Channel Name Block Format
Offset  Size    Description     Value
0x00    4       Block ID        "SOCN"
0x04    4       Block Data Size string length
0x08            ASCII String

Song Sheet Block - "SOSH"
This block is used to define the contents of all the cells of a sheet. It is always located
within a Song Block.

Song Sheet Block Format
Offset  Size    Description     Value
0x00    4       Block ID        "SOSH"
0x04    4       Block Data Size depends on format
0x08            Sheet Data

Sheet Data
The format of the sheet data depends on the values specified in the Song Information Block.

A sheet consists of 5 bytes per channel in 64 rows. The 5 bytes describe one cell with a note
number, sound number, note volume, command and parameter. The format is as follows:

Sheet Cell Format
Offset  Size    Description             Value
0x00    1       Note Number             see below
0x01    1       Sound Number            1 - 255, 0 = no change
0x02    1       Volume                  1 - 65, 0 = no change
0x03    1       Command                 0x00 - 0xFF
0x04    1       Command Parameter       0x00 - 0xFF

Note Number
A value of 0 means no note. In format version 1.4, a value of 2 - 49 may is used where 2 = C-1,
3 = C#1 ... 49 = B-4. In format version 1.6 2 = note off, 3 = C-1, 4 = C#1 ... 74 = B-5.

SBStudio saves all sheets in a packed format. The packed format is very simple, but may
sometimes dramatically reduce the file size.

When loading sheets, you should always assume they are packed. This will make your loader
compatible with both packed and unpacked sheets.

In a packed sheet, byte 0 or 2 in the 5 byte channel cell can contain a special byte. The
special bytes are:

Special Sheet Cell Bytes
Value   Meaning
0xFD    End of channel cell. Next byte is the first byte of the next channel cell.
0xFE    End of sheet row. Next byte is the first byte of the next row.
0xFF    End of sheet.

Sound Block - "SND "
This block is used to define a sound. It is located after Song Blocks in a PAC or at the start
of a SOU file.
